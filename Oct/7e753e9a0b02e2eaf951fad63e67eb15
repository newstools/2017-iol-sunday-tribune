DURBAN - In a historic first, Bollywood singing sensation, Arijit Singh, is set to deliver the “biggest Bollywood musical in Africa” when he arrives in Durban for the first time. That’s the word from organisers at Showtime Promotions who announced this week that Singh had given the go ahead to bring his concert extravaganza to Durban and Johannesburg. Singh’s impassioned voice saw Bollywood songs top music charts across the world especially with hits Tum Hi Ho, Channa Mereya, Zaalima, and Gerua. Singh is expected to perform his hits at the Durban International Convention Centre and at the New Menlyn Casino in Johannesburg in early February next year. “South African Bollywood music lovers have been crying for Arijit Singh’s concert, and here it is as an early Valentine’s Day,” said Showtime’s Vinay Hansraj. Hansraj said the concert is the biggest for Showtime Promotions as Singh’s team would touchdown in South African a month early to assure that venues were suitable for the singing legend and his accompanying musicians. “He has the biggest technical rider (checklist) we’ve ever seen in this country and it’s going to be the biggest Bollywood concert in Africa yet,” said Hansraj. In comparison, Hansraj looked back at Sonu Nigam’s 2009 concert and the 2004 Temptations event which saw actors including Sharukh Khan and Rani Mukherji perform dance items in Durban. Showtime’s Veesham Maharaj said the trio of organisers including Mike Narsey were always thinking ahead to find the best entertainment to bring to the South African stage. He said: “We’ve entertained hundreds of thousands of audience members in our 22 year history and it takes long periods of negotiations and challenges but at the end of the day the show must go on. Arijit Singh’s concert has been in the pipeline for a year and we are in talks for big things in 2018.” Tickets for Singh’s February concerts are expected to be on sale from R300 upwards next week via Computicket.
