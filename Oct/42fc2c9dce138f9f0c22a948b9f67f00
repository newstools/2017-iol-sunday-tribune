DURBAN - EThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede has failed again to release her “365 days in office” report. It has been more than 400 days since Gumede took over the reins at Durban City Hall after her party, the ANC, won elections in the eThekwini region during last year's municipal elections. DA KZN leader and eThekwini caucus leader, Zwakele Mncwango, said it was strange that the planned event has been postponed. “It is strange that it is exactly 407 days today since Mayor Zandile Gumede took office, yet she still wants to present '365 days in Office'," Mncwango said. Since the mayor was failing to table the report, Mncwango said the DA had compiled its own mini report on the mayor's first year in office. In this mini report, Mncwango blamed Gumede for the R120m spent on the Essence Festival between this year and last year and also for the R20m spent on Casspirs by the city. “The mayor has no good story to tell the people of eThekwini. The ANC has failed the people of eThekwini once again. From the non-functional call centres, clinics that are under-resourced and the non-transparent and corruption-riddled house allocation, eThekwini is closed for business under the current administration. "With the current goings-on in the ANC, perhaps the next media conference to be held would be her recall as mayor of eThekwini, which should bring a sigh of relief to the residents," he said. However, the Ethekwini mayor’s spokesman Mthunzi Gumede denied the allegations. He said Mayor Gumede other commitments related to the launch of transport month. “We have postponed for next week but the venue has not been secured yet.  The opposition is just using cheap politics to score points. Everything is working fine in the city we have lights and water, roads are also kept clean,” Gumede said. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
