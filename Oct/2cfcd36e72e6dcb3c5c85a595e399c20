The three boys were carrying T-shirts in support of South Africa’s third largest political party, the EFF, which read: “EFF: our last hope of getting the land back” and “loading 2019”. KZN Education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said the circuit manager would be sent to the school to investigate what happened. UPDATE: Mthethwa later added: "Our schools premises are not political playgrounds" Former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen was alarmed and angrily tweeted that picture was "total disrespect for a once great school”  In a reply to a tweet, Pietersen further stated that the three pupils were not allowed to make political statements in school uniform, but only in 'civvies'.
