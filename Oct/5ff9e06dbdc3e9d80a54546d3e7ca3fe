DURBAN Metro Police officers have recovered a stolen city vehicle within an hour, the municipality said. The vehicle, a Toyota Quantum, was stolen at gunpoint from a city official in Adams Mission, near eManzimtoti. The official is a female who works for the eThekwini Municipality’s electricity unit. She came under attack from a group of men when she stopped at a robot on Thursday evening. Metro Police Superintendent Kasey Naicker said the police acted swiftly after the matter was reported, recovering the vehicle within an hour. “The matter was reported to us immediately and we sent a team out to look for it,” he said. “We received word that the vehicle fitting its description was seen speeding into the south. Our team searched both KwaMakhutha and Folweni, before the vehicle was located in Nsimbini, in the Folweni area,” he said. The alleged hijackers abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot when they saw metro police in the area. They escaped. Acting Metro Police Head Steve Middleton commended the officers for the swift recovery. “Metro Police is more determined than ever to stop crime in the City. No disregard for by-laws, traffic law or criminal law will be tolerated. Anyone found breaking the law will be brought to book,” he said sternly. The metro police have also warned motorists that roadblocks are ongoing. Last weekend, the metro police arrested 99 drunk drivers. Said Middleton: “Drunken driving remains a huge problem on our roads. We are a taking a zero tolerance stance against this disgusting practice. Those found drinking and driving will face the full might of the law”. INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY
