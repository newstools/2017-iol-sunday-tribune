DURBAN - A TASTE of China was served at the traditional Chinese Moon Festival Cultural Gala this week at the Sibaya iZulu Theatre where South African and Chinese communities gathered to observe the harvest celebration. The Gala was hosted by the Consulate General of the People’s Republic of China, the South Africa KwaZulu-Natal Community and Police Cooperation Centre and the Durban University of Technology’s Confucius Institute. The Moon Festival is a cultural celebration of the harvest, full moon and Chinese heritage. Delegates were treated to traditional Chinese cuisine including Mooncakes, a small cake that is shared among family and friends to mark the Mid-Autumn Festival. Several DUT Confucius Institute students who have been studying the Mandarin language delivered performances to a crowd that roared with applause at the mastery of the language by the youngsters. PRC Consulate General, Wang Jianzhou, said the festival is shared too by the Durban community. “The hard-working Chinese people, Chinese food and culture, and Chinese business and investment in Durban are the best gift that China has given to South Africa,” he said. Meanwhile DUT Vice-Chancellor, Professor Thandwa Mthembu said South Africans have lessons to learn from the Asian country. Mthembu: “The Chinese people have great values and character among which are disciplined thought and action. They focus on their goal to advance their institution and their people. They draw the line and nobody may cross that. In South Africa, anybody or anything goes no matter how destructive it is to our common good as a nation.” WATCH: A glimpse into the 2017 Traditional Chinese Moon Festival and Cultural Gala   To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
