DURBAN - Dump the plastic and bring your basket. That’s fast becoming the new shopping mantra as businesses and organisations move away from single-use plastic bags. This week Hilton Quarry Superspar confirmed it had ditched plastic in favour of brown bags, and the popular Shongweni Farmers and Craft Market posted on social media that it  would no longer allow the use of plastic bags by the majority of their vendors from next Saturday. Superspar manager Sunil Mothilal said it had replaced plastic bags with brown bags, which cost R2.50, or customers could bring their own shopping bags. “The brown bags are more expensive than plastic but we are looking at the long term and we have tried to keep the cost as low as possible. We have had a lot of positive feedback,” said Mothilal. Owner of Shongweni market, Christine Standeaven, said their vendors had been advised that plastic bags would not be allowed as of next Saturday. This excludes packaging for meat and chicken. “There is no polystyrene allowed as we use compostable, bamboo or paper containers; and our knives and forks are made from corn starch or wood. We have also started withdrawing straws. “We haven’t had any adverse reaction,” she said. Next month, the market will host a “Most Unusual Basket” competition. Steve Cohen, of Durban Partnership Against Plastic Pollution, said social media was having a major impact on encouraging the use of environmentally-friendly packaging and bags. “Although I have not noticed a particular surge in SA towards retailers ‘banning the bag’, looking at social media traffic in the country, there is much greater awareness of the harm single-use plastic is having on our planet. “Individuals are becoming much more active in putting pressure on retailers and brand owners to provide more environmentally friendly alternatives to plastic packaging,” said Cohen, urging consumers to put pressure on large retail chains.
