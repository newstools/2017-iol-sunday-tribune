DURBAN - A group of about 100 protesters took to the streets of the Howell Road social housing complex in Sydenham on Saturday to protest over housing eviction in the area. The residents who were evicted from their homes in August protested because they did not want new tenants to occupy “their” homes. New occupants allegedly began occupying the homes on Saturday despite a pending application in the Durban High Court to deem the evictions illegal. The evictions came after residents refused to pay rent, saying that they had been promised to “rent to own” the houses. They later found out that this was not the case. Maurine Rambhadursing from a local NGO called The Poor Flat Dwellers Association said it was unethical for new tenants to occupy the homes knowing there was a pending court matter to deem the August evictions illegal. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed there were protests in the area earlier on Saturday. She said the situation had quietened this evening and the group of protesters were cleared. “However, there are still police officers stationed in the area to ensure that the area remains calm for the rest of the evening. The protest is because the evicted residents do not want new people to occupy the homes,” said Gwala. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
