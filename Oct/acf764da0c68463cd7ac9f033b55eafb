Zuma swung by the Durban North mansion of First Lady Thobeka Zuma where the couple’s daughter, Nqobile, celebrated her tenth birthday with friends today. The First Lady captured light-hearted moments at the colourful event where Zuma was seen having a chat with some of Nqobile’s friends. On Instagram, Thobeka thanked Zuma for surprising the kids citing #familygoals. “Thank you Daddy dearest for making Princess Nqonqo’s dream come true. A Birthday is a celebration of life. Your friends and family there to give you something that will make you smile. For someone who’s turning 10 this year, I’m sure giving a gift was not enough but the best gift was to have your busy parents present on your Special Day. The opportunity to let you know how much we care and make this special day memorable to you darling. Time flies, make sure you enjoy every second of it. We love you pumpkin. #birthdaygirl #familyfirst#familygoals #diaryofamom,” she said.   Thank you Daddy dearest for making Princess Nqonqo’s dream come true. A Birthday is a celebration of life.
