KZN MIDLANDS - “Michaelhouse has been a community and a family for Themba," said Thabo Dloti, the father of the 16-year-old boy who died in a bus accident on Tuesday. Dloti spoke at a memorial service for his son held at the highly regarded private school in the Midlands on Friday. The school’s chapel was filled to capacity as over a thousand people gathered in honour the Grade 10 pupil. Some sat in the school quadrant, and others in a separate prayer hall, where a live-stream of the memorial service was projected. The youngster was among the 49 Michaelhouse learners on the their way to a soccer tournament when the hired bus they had travelled in apparently had a tyre blow-out, which caused the vehicle to somersault on the N3 near Pietermaritzburg. Themba’s father described him as an adventurous boy who charmed family and friends with his warm smile. "We need to remember his legacy," said Dloti, the former chief executive of financial services company Liberty. When the school's choir, which Themba had been part of, sang Amazing Grace and Be Thou My Vision, learners became emotional and some wiped away tears. After the service, a large crowd gathered around Themba’s parents and brother, and offered condolences.   Speaking on behalf of the Dloti family, Themba’s uncle, Kabelo, thanked the public for their support. "We are still grieving, it has been easier to have the support of so many people," he said. The funeral takes place on Tuesday in Midrand, Gauteng, where Dloti says a wall of remembrance will be erected for messages to Themba. Michaelhouse rector, Greg Thereon, thanked the public for showering concern over their pupils who were involved in the accident, some of whom were still recovering in hospital. "We have been providing counselling to learners who have been affected," he assured. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
