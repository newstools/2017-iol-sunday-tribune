Cape Town — South African actress Minnie Dlamini married long-term boyfriend Quinton Jones in Lourensford Wine Estate in Somerset West on Saturday — and she looked amazing in her Gert-Johan Coetzee wedding dress. The pair tied the knot in a traditional ceremony in July. Fellow TV personality and former Miss South Africa, Basetsana Julia "Bassie" Kumalo, was among the guests. A few hours before Minnie and Quinton would commit to "for better for worse, till death do us part", Bassie shared a heartfelt message for the soon-to-be Missus Jones on Instagram. She wrote: "As you walk down the isle today @minniedlamini may the peace of God that surpasses all understanding guard your heart and be with you. Remember "love is patient, love is kind,it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud, it does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails". 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. Congratulations to you and Quinton on your special day. Sending you all my love.💞💖💕💜 #IminiKaMinnie.
