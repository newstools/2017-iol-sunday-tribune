Durban - Prayers are pouring in for the over 40 school boys that have been injured after the hired bus transporting them to a soccer tournament overturned on the N3 near Pietermaritzburg, on Tuesday. One schoolboy lost his life. The boys from Michaelhouse, a premier Midlands school, were members of the school's under-16 team heading to Kearsney College for a fixture. The statement released by Michaelhouse rector, Greg Theron, read, “The bus suffered a blow-out going down Townhill near Pietermaritzburg and flipped onto its side.”
ER24 spokesperson, Derrick Banks, said two children have been critically injured.
"After being treated on-site for injuries ranging from minor to serious, patients were taken to various hospitals in Pietermaritzburg.” On Twitter, local schools and concerned citizens have posted their tributes:     And on the Michaelhouse Facebook page: 
Kebonye Gaetsaloe: “Our prayers are with their families and the rest of the MHS family.”
Sandra Martain: “Can’t imagine the devastation felt by our MHS family. We feel it too.”
Chantel Lancaster: “Thoughts, prayers, love and strength to all Michaelhouse boys, staff and families, just devastating.”  There have been a number of accidents, some fatal, involving school children this year. Last month, six pupils aged between 13 and 15 were killed in a taxi collision near Dalton in KZN. In April, 16 pre-primary school children were injured in a taxi crash in Reservoir Hills, after which police declared that a case of reckless and negligent driving would be investigated. Tragedy struck at the start of the school year when four children, who were on their way to start their new school year, were killed in a taxi accident in Ntuzuma, and 16 others were injured. It was alleged that the taxi driver had been driving the overloaded vehicle above the speed limit. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
