Durban - eThekwini Municipality’s Transport Authority will test on-board wifi on ten People Mover buses that travel in the inner city for the next nine months. The city said this was to look at internet provision for the new integrated rapid public transport network GO!Durban.
 
Using the People Mover, the city said it would provide free wifi access of 250MB daily to commuters, on their ride around the city. 
 
The GO!Durban project envisages the provision of wifi on buses travelling on major routes, as well as within stations. "This will allow commuters to access time-tables, check out routes and connections, and watch for updates from the authority's management centre. Of course, they would be able to use it for work and recreational purposes as well. It's a big bonus for those who commute long distances and could use the access for improved productivity,” said Thami Manyathi, head of the authority.
 
“We look forward to seeing how effective wifi on public transport can be and how it can support the commuters in a positive way.”
 The city said GO!Durban branding would be placed on the side of the buses so that commuters can identify which buses provide free Wi-Fi over this period, with connectivity details on-board the bus. The network is named eThekwini_WiFi and users will initially need to create an account by inputting their details or sign in with their social media accounts. These login details will be used for future connectivity.
