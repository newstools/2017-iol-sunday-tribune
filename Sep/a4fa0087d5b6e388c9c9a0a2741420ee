Durban - More arrests have been made in the aftermath of the funeral service of Sandile “Chillies” Bhengu, the alleged kingpin in a Durban hijacking syndicate. The SAPS confirmed in a statement on Monday that they had made seven arrests over the weekend following a night vigil for the gang leader in Umlazi. The initial arrests were made during a roadblock and crime prevention operations the SAPS conducted in the area on Friday evening. SAPS spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said they were positioned in Umlazi’s V Section when they spotted a vehicle spinning tyres on a street. The vehicle was stopped and police recovered dagga from the car. Three suspects found in the vehicle were aged between 22 and 27 years old and appeared in the Umlazi Magistrate's court on Monday, Mbehele revealed. She said the SAPS arrested two men at a hall in Umlazi’s M Section, the next day. The suspects were dressed in national servicemen uniforms but after questioning them, police discovered that both men were not employed by the state and were subsequently arrested. They were charged with impersonating law enforcement officers. Police were on patrol in J Section when shots were fired at them on Saturday evening. Additional vehicles were deployed to the area and two men were arrested. The suspects were found to be in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. KZN Acting Provincial Police Commissioner Major General Bheki Langa praised all the members and other law enforcement agencies for their outstanding work in Umlazi and surrounding areas. “We cannot allow criminals to make such serious threats against organs of the state. Over the weekend it was quite clear that those who support criminals are in the minority and most people do not support lawlessness. “The presence of law enforcement officers in the area contributed to minimum incidents being reported in Umlazi and law and ordered prevailed,” said Langa.
