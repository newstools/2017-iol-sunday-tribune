DURBAN: The KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda has warned bus operators and drivers, who will be ferrying maidens to the annual Reed Dance ceremony in Nongoma this weekend, that law enforcement officers will leave nothing to chance to ensure the maidens travelled safe. On Thursday Kaunda visited the Durban bus depot as part of the province-wide inspections to ascertain the road-worthiness of buses that will be transporting over 45 000 maidens to the cultural extravaganza at King Zwelithini’s Enyokeni Royal Palace.
 
In 2013, a bus crash in Eshowe claimed the lives of 12 maidens died, after the driver lost control of the vehicle, which capsized.  Kaunda said his the department was doing everything in its power to prevent a repeat of such tragedy.   
He said that about 3000 law enforcement officers would be deployed on all the routes leading to Nongoma. 
“Our officers will stage 17 roadblocks focusing on drunk driving, overloading, vehicle roadworthiness, excessive speed, vehicle and driver's licences,” promised Kaunda. Law enforcement officers from municipalities, Road Traffic Inspectorate and the SAPS will be on high alert and closely monitoring all points of departure as per the list provided by the Department of Arts and Culture.  
Law enforcement officers have been instructed to target all vehicles with a special focus on buses travelling towards Nongoma. Kaunda has appealed to motorists who would be using these routes to be patient as stop and go checks will be the order of the day.
“Drivers will be subjected to random alcohol checks. We also want to appeal to bus operators to provide adequate accommodation for their drivers to ensure that they are well rested ahead of their return trips,” said Kaunda.
