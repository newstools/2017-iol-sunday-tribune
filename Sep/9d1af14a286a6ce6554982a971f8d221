He has since made appearances on several US late-night talk shows, including on The Late Late Show with James Corden on which the karaoke series aired until technology giant, Apple, bought the rights to the feature last year. The show reveals celebrities sitting in a vehicle on the busy streets of a picturesque town singing along to their favourite songs that are playing on the car radio. In the trailer for the upcoming episode, Noah and Colombian-born Shakira, drive across Barcelona, Spain, singing to some of Shakira’s hit songs, including Whenever, Wherever and Hips Don’t Lie.
