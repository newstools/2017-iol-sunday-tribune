Durban - A Verulam mother was killed by her boyfriend on Sunday after she allegedly threatened to kill their infant child during an argument, Reaction Unit South Africa said. At midday Rusa security guards were called to the scene of the incident at Jacaranda Avenue in Mountview by residents requesting medical assistance for an injured woman, said Prem Balram, Rusa spokesperson. “Upon arrival the woman was assessed by medics and was found to have been stabbed twice, once in the chest and a second time in the back with a large kitchen knife. She showed no signs of life and was pronounced dead on arrival,” said Balram. He said, the boyfriend’s family who live in a separate building on the same property alleged that the mother and her 23-year-old boyfriend were arguing about his infidelity throughout the night. Balram said she accused him of being HIV positive and believed that the infant was also infected. She then threatened to kill the infant when her boyfriend drew a knife, stabbed her and fled the scene. “The seriously injured woman attempted to seek assistance from her boyfriend's family but collapsed outside her shack. The infant was not injured,” continued Balram. A case of murder is being investigated. Daily News
