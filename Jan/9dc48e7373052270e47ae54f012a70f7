Durban - SMS-speak has its advantages but an Aussie tourism campaign for its Northern Territory took things a little too far, albeit unintentionally.The UK s Daily Mirror reported that the offending slogan became an online sensation after it was ruled obscene by watchdog groups.According to the newspaper, the slogan See you in the Northern Territory was shortened to CU in the NT .Now the unofficial marketing slogan has its own website, Facebook page, and Instagram. Merchandise-like T-shirts is also being produced. Experience the unique Northern Territory in Australia s Top End for an unforgettable experience, the ad campaign says. Tell your friends CU in the NT .CU in Durbs doesn t quite have the same ring to it.Sunday Tribune
