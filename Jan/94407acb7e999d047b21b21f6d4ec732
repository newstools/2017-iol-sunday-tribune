Durban - Sixty years ago, Louis van der Westhuizen made headlines as Durban s tiniest baby.Born at Addington Hospital on January 28, 1957, he weighed only 793g. He was born at five months and was so small a wedding ring encompassed his arm. At the time, many people wondered if he would live. Fast forward 60 years and Van der Westhuizen is living life to his fullest. My mom said I was smaller than other babies born, but I survived. I lived in an incubator in hospital and was released after three months when I had picked up weight. And, surprisingly, when I was growing up I never had any medical complications. Van der Westhuizen is married with two daughters and lives in Swellendam.He turned 60 yesterday and planned to celebrate by having a braai with his family. I am just grateful for life more than anything and to also still have my mother around. Van der Westhuizen s mother, Denise, 88, said she remembers very well the day she gave birth to her son. I was five months pregnant and had seen the doctor for a check up and I was told I would give birth in May. The following week, I had visited a friend at her house and while we were talking a child ran in with an injured foot that was bleeding. &quot;I felt sick and was taken to hospital and gave birth. They said I was probably distraught and frightened by that incident. Denise only touched her son for the first time after three months. Louis was very small and he was the tiniest premature baby to have survived. He lived in a glass incubator. I wasn t allowed to touch him. I was able to touch and hold him after three months and it was the best feeling to hold him and to see my little boy growing. He grew up to be a normal child without any medical challenges.
