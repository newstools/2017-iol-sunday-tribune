Durban - The sky is no limit for Durban-born scientist Dr Valanathan Munsami, as he takes up the post of chief executive at the South African National Space Agency (Sansa).Munsami, 48, who was born in Clairwood and raised in Chatsworth, was appointed last week to succeed Dr Sandile Malinga.Honoured by the appointment, he said he had had an eventful career shaping South Africa s space science landscape. I held a number of posts in the Department of Science and Technology, the latest as chief representative since last February. I was meant to take up a post in Ethiopia, but chose to remain here, he said. Munsami, who has a PhD in physics from the University of Natal, has always been passionate about space science. He sees it as an integral part of life, without which the world would not function.&quot;Sansa does not investigate planets or undertake deep space missions like Nasa because we are a developing country,&quot; he said. &quot;Instead we focus on satellites. He aims to develop the satellite industry. Satellites are used to monitor how the environment and human settlements are changing, which is vital to the government. We are the only country in Africa that can build our own satellites. As head of the organisation, he will focus on industry development, increasing its share of the world satellite market and improving space applications.Munsami's message to aspiring scientists is that science is fun. It s such a fascinating career. You re always investigating new boundaries and discovering new things. No day is ever boring. Sunday Tribune
