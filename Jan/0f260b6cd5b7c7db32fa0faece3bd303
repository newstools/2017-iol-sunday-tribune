Durban - Cell C recently announced price changes to its prepaid and contract packages effective from February 1. The price of data bundles will be hiked by between eight percent and 25 percent next month, while out-of-bundle call rates will increase by between 10 percent and 25 percent per minute. In a letter to customers, the operator said it intended submitting the amended tariff plans to communications regulator Icasa for approval. The Communications Workers Union described Cell C s announcement as reckless and insensitive. Cell C s price increase comes after consumers called for South African network providers to decrease the price of data with the #DataMustfall campaign.Sunday Tribune
