DURBAN: THE collaboration by the country’s six performing arts institutions in Joburg to showcase their development programmes in the past week was ground-breaking. 
The Arts Incubator Trade Fair at the Market Theatre ends today.
Riveting poetry, dance and drama offerings came from Artscape, the Performing Arts Centre of the Free State (Pacofs), the Durban Playhouse, the State Theatre, the Windybrow Arts Centre and the Market Theatre.
In the past two years, each of these state-funded institutions received cash injections from the Department of Arts and Culture’s Incubator Fund to run programmes that would unleash the economic potential of the creative sector. 
Arts practitioners were subjected to a structured programme of skills training and development to produce local content for the performing and visual arts sectors. 
Having made an impact in their own spaces with projects they had developed, the six brought their kaleidoscope of acts to the Market Theatre during the week.
As part of proceedings, artists participated in a series of capacity-building workshops led by some of Joburg’s most dynamic writers, directors, designers and arts administrators.
The Durban Playhouse performed a play inspired by post-apartheid youth called /’fri:d?m/, which draws on classical South African theatre, images and sound to find meaning for what we have achieved as a country.
• Parasuramen is well known on the local arts scene.
