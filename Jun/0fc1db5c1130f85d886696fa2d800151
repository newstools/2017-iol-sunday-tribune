Thereza Botha testified yesterday for the second day in the murder trial involving Jayde’s husband, Christopher Panayiotou, and two co-accused. According to the data, the vehicle rented by Jayde’s alleged killer, Sizwe Vumazonke, left his house at 5.24am and travelled close to where Sinethemba Nenembe was. Data indicated that Vumazonke made a call to both Nenembe and Khusta Vandala. At 6.03am the vehicle was at the intersection of the R102 and Kabega Road in Port Elizabeth. Some 40 minutes later, Vumazonke again called Vandala. Vumazonke’s handset received reception from the Linton Grange tower near Jayde’s home, while Vandala’s reception came from Kwadesi. At 6.27am vehicle tracker data indicated harsh braking. Botha’s evidence revealed this was the last time the vehicle circled the Stellen Glen Complex. The vehicle moved along the N2, on to the R102 towards Uitenhage. By 7.09am Vumazonke made a call to self-confessed middleman Luthando Siyoni. Data places Vumazonke’s phone in Kwanobhule township. At 7.12am the vehicle’s transmission was switched off. “The measurement of the point where the vehicle ignition was switched off, and where (Jayde’s) body was found is 22 metres,” Botha said. The trial continues. - ANA
