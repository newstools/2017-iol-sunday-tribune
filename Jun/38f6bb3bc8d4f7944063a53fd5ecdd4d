DURBAN – On Monday, the King of R&B, R. Kelly surprised South Africans, especially Durbanites, when his weekly #FanFeatureMonday went to a Durban fan’s rendition of R. Kelly’s famous song, “Bad Man”.  This week's #FanFeatureMonday is a video that was taken at a taxi rank, where a young man pretends the rank is his stage and he sings his heart out to the R. Kelly song.  Even though those recording the video of the man singing were laughing their heads off, the man got recognition from none other than R. Kelly.   Singing at a taxi rank is common in South Africa, because that is where the crowds are. One duo was lucky as they were discovered after singing at a taxi rank. Soul Kulture, an afro soul singing duo, was discovered after they sang at a Khayelitsha taxi rank.  South Africans were happy that R. Kelly used a South African in his #FanFeatureMonday for the week:  Here is R. Kelly singing “Bad Man”:
