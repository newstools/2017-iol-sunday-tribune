Early on Thursday morning, hundreds of racegoers and a few fashionistas made their way to the Gallops, held at Greyville Racecourse. Horses, especially the favourite to win the Vodacom Durban July main event, Edict of Nantes, showed off their speed and their shiny coats at the Gallops. Unfortunately, Edict of Nantes did not live up to expectations as the horse seemed to slow down along the stretch.
