"Cabinet has noted with serious concern the media reports on the ‘leaked emails’ that are purported to implicate ministers, officials and private individuals in alleged wrongdoing," it said in a statement after its regular fortnightly meeting. It said the suggestion in a trove of leaked emails detailing improper actions to advance the Gupta family's business interests must be investigated by law enforcement. Where cases have already been opened, it urged officials to cooperate. "Cabinet remains fully committed to good governance and at the same time, it also notes that all persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty in terms of our Constitution. "It is aware that some cases have already been opened, and the police are undertaking the necessary investigations. All who are affected by the emails are urged to cooperate with the law-enforcement agencies." The leaked emails of Gupta associates, have indicated that the family benefited massively from Transnet contracts, received preferential treatment from home affairs, were sent Mineral Affairs Minister Mosebenzi Zwane's CV before he was appointed and that ministers and the South African Revenue Service gave them secret information.
