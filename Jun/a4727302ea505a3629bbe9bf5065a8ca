In his latest denials in reply to a set of parliamentary questions, Zwane insists that the controversial family is merely a mining industry stakeholder. He again denied flying out with the Guptas to Switzerland to facilitate the sale of the Optimum mine to a company owned by the Guptas and President Jacob Zuma’ son, Duduzane Zuma. His denials come after Parliament on Monday instructed chairpersons of committees to hold accountable the cabinet ministers implicated in the “leaked” e-mails. Some of the ministers 
implicated in the “leaked” e-mails have denied some aspects relating to their actions contained in the documents while others have defended their actions. Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said portfolio committees have been directed to “urgently” probe the allegations and report back to the National Assembly. Zwane, who is among the ministers featured in the e-mails, has denied everything. He described the Guptas as “mining industry stakeholders”. Zwane also ducked questions asking his comment on allegations that the Gupta family was involved in his appointment and that they had been sent his CV. “The president appoints ministers and assigns their powers and functions and may dismiss them,” he said in his response. He also reiterated his previous replies about his trip to Switzerland, saying it had been organised and paid for by his department. Zwane’s response was contrary to the reports from leaked e-mails showing that he flew to Switzerland with the Guptas and their associates in the family’s private jet. Daily News
