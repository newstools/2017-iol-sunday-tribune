DURBAN – Anti-apartheid photojournalist Ranjith Kally has died aged 91. He passed away on Tuesday morning at his daughters home in Johannesburg. Kally, a former photojournalist with the Golden City Post and Drum Magazine had a penchant for capturing some iconic figures of the Anti-Apartheid struggle. One of Kally's celebrated shot was a picture of political stalwarts Dr Monty Naicker, Nelson Mandela, Dr Yusuf Dadoo, and others of the South African Indian Congress and the ANC, captured in 1963, when they were seen leaving the Pretoria Synagogue during the treason trial. Kally was born in Reunion near Isiphingo in Durban on November 26, 1925. He is survived by his children Jyoti, Jyanti and Pavitra, and grandchildren Dhirren and Ashali. Satish Dupelia, Mahatma Gandhi's grandson and media personality, paid tribute to Kally on Facebook. "As a 14 year old boy I studied photography and darkroom work but had no darkroom. Uncle Ranjith let me use his room with the proviso that I kept it as clean as I found it," he wrote. "When Percy Sledge came down flash photography was banned as Percy had an eye problem. Uncle Ranjith did not moan and shot using a slightly higher speed film and darkroom techniques to produce brilliant shots that even Percy Sledge commented on. He was a great but humble gentleman and earned my respect. He was and is a legend but to those who knew him he was a warm hearted person with a classic sense of humour and was also never scared to call a spade a spade (to speak his mind). REST IN PEACE UNCLE RANJITH KALLY – a legend gone!" In June last year, the Sunday Tribune Herald featured him in the popular "Our Heroes" feature. Independent Media's Mervyn Naidoo spoke to him at the time, this is what the legendary South African photojournalist had to say. HIS LIFE BEHIND A CAMERA EXPOSED SUNDAY TRIBUNE
