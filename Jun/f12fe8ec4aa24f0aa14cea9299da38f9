Organised by the Shongweni Farmer’s and Craft Market and The Independent on Saturday, Craft Fest brought some of the best craft drink brewers from around the country to the fields of Shongweni. There were craft beers, gins, ciders and wines, gourmet food and arts and crafts. Standeaven Brewery, Scavenger Brewery, and Darling Brewery were some of the brands on offer. Dean Amra and his friends, all from the Bluff, said they enjoyed the selection at the Craft Fest. “We enjoyed the gin and tonic, the Hamilton Hammer and the ciders. The atmosphere here is great as well, even the scenery. It’s been an awesome day out,” he said. Maliga Govender, from Phoenix, said she had enjoyed the food on offer, especially foods that she could not easily find, and was keen to try out the vegetarian taco she had bought. Lulama Chamane and Sanele Sophazi, from Clermont, said their children were enjoying playing in the kiddies area, while they sipped craft drinks. “It’s a good day out in Durban; the sun is shining and we are having a good time,” Sophazi said. The Independent on Saturday editor, Deon Delport, said: “A huge thank you to Craft Fest visitors for a wonderful turnout. Shongweni Farmers Market and The Independent on Saturday are very excited about the interest from the public about craft drinks. It was a fun family day and the weather played along.” THE INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY
