Some of Durban’s punters have shared their tips. These punters spend hours at the racetrack  studying the horses that will run. According to the punters, one of three horses could gallop away with the colossal R425 0000 in the seventh race. The Daily News asked three punters - Raymond Harriparsad, Sumeshen Moodley and Vishen Rupee - who to bet on for the July . Harriparsad said as a punter he studied the horses and the races the horse ran, the weight the horse carried and its merit rating.

He said It’s My Turn would win the Durban July. “In last year’s July, he ran a cracker of a race and now it’s a year older, it’s a much more mature horse and therefore I think it’s got a very good chance of winning.” Moodley, on the other hand, said it was hard to look past the favourite, Edict of Nantes, or The Conglomerate. “Edict of Nantes stands above his age group and he looks a certainty on the card. Last year, The Conglomerate won the July off a merit rating of 101. This year his merit rating hasn’t made much of a difference to the weight that he will be carrying. It can make him a massive runner in repeating the win for a July double.” Rupee agreed with Moodley, saying Edict of Nantes would win the race. “I like the jockey and the way he won the Daily News 2000, with so much of confidence. I feel like he is going to win this race as well.” The main race is scheduled to take place at 4.20pm on Saturday. Daily News
