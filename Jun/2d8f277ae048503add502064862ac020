As the French invasion comes to Durban’s shores, one of its stars, Frédéric Michalak, warned and encouraged players from the French Barbarian team and the national team to watch out for Durban’s renowned curries while they were in the city. The former Sharks player recommended a bunny chow for his teammates. The French Barbarians are playing the South African “A” team at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday. Michalak, who had two spells with the Sharks in 2008 and 2011, said he was happy to be back in Durban. The 34-year-old French Barbarians captain said: “It feels good to see familiar faces. It is a feeling like you are home, like you are with family.” With the French team currently touring the country, Michalak said one of the foods he remembered the most was Durban’s famous bunny chow. Recalling the first time he ate it, he said it was recommended by then fellow teammate, JPPietersen. Being French, Michalak said he was not accustomed to eating spicy food and mused that he ate the bunny chow by eating the outside bread part first because it was extremely hot. It was not only the food that he said should be explored, but the city itself: “You can go everywhere. You can go to the beach, the Indian market, which is amazing, and also KwaMashu.” He said people should not focus on news about crime that might deter them coming here and that there were a lot of beautiful places in Durban. On Friday's match, the Lyon player said they had a short time to prepare, but wanted to ensure they enjoyed the game and Durban. Coming from last week’s loss, Michalak said the French national team have had better time to prepare and would have to play all out for the full game because South Africa had a strong side. A “pragmatic” approach would be best, he said. The Springboks are playing the national side on Saturday. Daily News
