The fate of the remaining contestants now lies in the hands of the voting public, which means coaches Bobby van Jaarsveld, Lira, Kahn Morbee and Karen Zoid are effec-
tively eye candy. Only six of the top eight contenders are known. Now it depends on which of the remaining contestants in Lira and Van Jaarsveld’s teams raked in the most viewer votes this week. After Lira had chosen powerhouse performer Tender Mavundla for the top eight in last week’s episode, viewers had to vote for effervescent Bubbles Mnomiya, rocker Luke Lovemore or Stilfontein’s Marissa Petzer. In #TeamBobby the race was on between engineer Marco Basson, lawyer Caroline Brussow and matriculant John-James Janse van Rensburg. This after Bobby gave charismatic singer Josh Ansley exemption from the vote. Tender and Josh joined previously saved contestants Craig Lucas and Fatman from #TeamKahn, as well as Samantha Leonard and PJ Pretorius from  Zoid’s team. Today, The Voice SA host Lungile Radu will reveal who else made it to the top eight. The third live show of the season will also feature spectacular new vocal performances, as well as guest artists. Friend of The Voice SA and season two co-coach Elvis Blue won’t be the only famous singer to take the stage at the Mosaiek Teatro - Durban-born Majozi will be performing too.
