Rodrigues, 23, was a soldier in the French Foreign Legion. He died saving eight crewmen when their raft capsized during a training exercise. Rodrigues joined the French Legion two years ago. He was buried with full military honours in France. A memorial service was held for him at Durban High School (DHS), where he matriculated in 2011. Speaking during his son’s service, Aires Rodrigues said he believed his son was destined for greatness. “Him joining the French Foreign Legion showed how courageous he was. It also shows how loving and loyal he was. He had an independent spirit that allowed him to be the man he was.” Rodrigues achieved much in his 23 years and travelled widely from an early age. “His love of languages and culture became evident early on and his desire to please and make friends internationally proved to be valuable later in life when he joined the French Foreign Legion. He was able to tolerate and accept others, no matter their background,” his father said. According to his family, Lorenzo’s motto was, “rather be hated for being honest than loved for lies”, which illustrated the kind of person he was. The family thanked all who attended the service and hoped those who had come to know Lorenzo would keep his spirit alive in their hearts. Daily News
