    Mayor Zandile Gumede this week sent off invites to host a breakfast in honour of Babes Wodumo and Nasty C who nominees in the prestigious BET awardsThe breakfast is due to take place on Wednesday morning.          The DA Caucus Leader of the eThekwini Municipality, Zwakele Mncwago took to Facebook to express his thoughts on the breakfast.  "This municipality will collapse in no time, don't say we didn't warn South Africa. Wasteful expenditure, irregularities, mismanagement of funds, corruption, unnecessary events like this one are a top priority to the ANC..." said Mncwango. Mbali Ntuli, DA spokesperson in the KZN Legislature said on Facebook: "Durban is hosting a send-off breakfast for Babes Wodumo and Nasty C to the BET awards. I support the thought behind the gesture and i really like both Babes and Nasty but I really hope the city got sponsors for this event and didn't use taxpayers money. We just can't afford it being solely funded by taxpayers in these trying times".    Mdu Nkosi, IFP spokesperson said there was absolutely nothing wrong with the breakfast.   "Firstly, they are nominated in something different. Secondly, It is about 'good luck'. They are going to represent eThekwini, KwaZulu-Natal and South Africa. It is part of Durban Tourism. They always budget for these functions. Besides, it has an economic spin off, tourists would want to come to South Africa to see more of our artists. So good luck to them." said Nkosi.  Mayoral spokesman, Mthunzi Gumede eThekwini  said eThekwini was hosting the event with Durban Tourism. He said the breakfast would be held at Moses Mabhida Stadium because a video would be recorded of the artists which would be used to promote the city. The cost of the function was not yet determined. "We had similar events for the Sharks rugby team, Ladysmith Black Mambazo and swimmer Chad le Clos. It is an opportunity to market ourselves to the world,” Gumede said. Daily News
