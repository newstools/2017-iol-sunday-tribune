Alongside his Wolf Pack crew - Aewon Wolf and Kyle Deutsch - he has made his mark on the music industry. Sketchy Bongo was nominated in two South African Music Awards (Sama) categories - best newcomer and best pop album and record of the year for Cold Shoulder with Locnville. The 28-year-old Westville artist, whose real name is Yuvir Pillay, is currently reaping the fruits of his hard labour. He recently opened a concert for US pop sensation Justin  Bieber in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Although he has already made a name for himself in the music industry, he said being part of Bieber's South African tour was a big milestone for him. “It was great opening for Bieber. There were 60000 people in each venue and it was such an amazing experience performing for so many people. It was definitely the biggest show I’ve ever played at,” he said. Sketchy is also known for the mask he wears during live performances. “I wear the mask in live shows to create a character for the audience to watch. The mask gets me in the zone. I don’t normally wear it for anything except live performance." His hit songs include Let You Know, Sniff Sniff and Cold Shoulder. He said his journey in the music industry had been good so far. “I’m happy that people are enjoying the music I create and this has allowed me to create music full-time. The most memorable moment for me was hearing my song on the radio for the first time. Now it’s normal, but back then it was so exciting and it really made me feel good.” SUNDAY TRIBUNE
