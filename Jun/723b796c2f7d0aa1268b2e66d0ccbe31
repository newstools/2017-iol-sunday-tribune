Debideen is an audiologist, but when she is not seeing patients works as a professional model, dancer and actress. “Modelling was a childhood dream. As a child, I was enthralled by the glitz and glamour of beauty pageants,” she said. Since taking part in her first pageant in 2013, she has won several titles, including Miss India South Africa KZN 2013, second princess in Miss India South Africa 2013 and Miss Catwalk 2016. “After winning my first pageant, I did a course in modelling, grooming and etiquette. I joined the agency Glamorous Models SA. And in the past four years I’ve helped train contestants and judged beauty pageants,” she said. She said when she won the Miss India SA KZN 2013, she had a handful of supporters at the start and “when it was time to crown the queen, the entire audience began to shout my name”. She said she hoped her journey would inspire other women not to let society's judgement and stereotyping stop them from pursuing their dreams “Especially in certain cultures, it's looked down upon to wear swimwear or take part in beauty pageants. My message to women is that if you have a dream, you should not let anything hold you back.” She urged people in KZN to vote for her. “The one who gets the most votes will receive the People’s Choice Award. SMS 'Win Yajna' to 47439", she said. The winner will compete for the Miss Supranational world title in Poland in December.
