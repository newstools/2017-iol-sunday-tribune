 DURBAN: A PAIR of North Coast siblings have upped their affinity for the ancient art form of yoga with the physically challenging acro-yoga,  a fusion of yoga and acrobatics, which is trending among enthusiasts. Michaela, 21, and her 22-year-old brother, Sean Naidoo, took to yoga a few years ago, having followed in the footsteps f their sporting parents. With Wednesday being International Yoga day, it will be business as usual for the Naidoo siblings and their parents, who are advocates of healthy lifestyles and daily exercise. Michaela said: “We bond as a family over yoga, it makes us feel more relaxed, and strengthens and tones our bodies.” The duo believe that acro-yoga is taxing but a worthwhile addition to their exercise routines. “My brother is a professional body-builder which requires a strict diet and a regimented gym schedule while I exercise every day with my mum,” said Michaela. They believe yoga leads them on a path to positivity, gives the body relief from common ailments and is a source of confidence. They said that busy-bee youth can always find the time to keep fit. Sean said, “For students, it is equally important to exercise their bodies to maintain a relaxed positive state of mind, and they shouldn’t  miss meals, but eat healthy foods, and always stay hydrated.” The siblings hope to use their passion for yoga and fitness on a professional level in the future. Michaela is determined to broaden her yoga knowledge at the Ashtanga Institute in India. She said, “Yoga is a very interesting sport for anyone of all ages to pursue but seek medical and professional advice before you attempt any advanced form of yoga. I hope to pass on my yoga experience to younger generations and other enthusiasts in the future." SUNDAY TRIBUNE
