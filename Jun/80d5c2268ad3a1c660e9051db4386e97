DURBAN â€“ Two examiners and two instructors were arrested at a Durban testing station following a nine month-long undercover operation by members of Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) and the police. Moses Dlamini, spokesman for Ipid, said the operation was designed to address both the local driving schools and the Metro Police drivers examiners regarding the payments for bribes for drivers licences. "It has been alleged that the driving school instructors approached learner drivers who come to them for lessons with the option for a bribe to be paid. The allegations included that should the learner driver agree then a bribe is paid to the instructor. The instructor then takes his cut of the bribe and in turn pays the examiner who assists the learner to pass the test," said Dlamini. He said since August last year they had been monitoring operations. "In May this year, two undercover agents were placed with the examiners. The operation resulted in two driving school instructors and two examiners, employed by Durban Metro Police, being arrested on two counts of corruption each," said Dlamini. The four are due to appear in the Verulam Magistrate's Court. Daily News
