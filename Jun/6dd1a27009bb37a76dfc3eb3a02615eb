CHAMPIONING the cause for the poor, Section 27’s Mark Heywood will today (SUN) run his 18th Comrades Marathon with a goal of raising R1 million for the non-profit organisation.  Heywood, who is an executive director at Section 27, said running the Comrades Marathon was a personal passion of his. The organisation received donor funding from abroad, but he has since decided to participate in various races in order to raise funds for the organisation.  “The biggest challenge is raising money for this work, we have a staff of nearly 40 people many of them are lawyers, and we have to pay them. In the past all of our money was raised overseas. “The reason I am doing this Comrades for Section 27 is because I am trying to say to people, we must own our own social justice organisations, we must own our own constitution, it can’t be funded by Europeans or Swedish people,” said Heywood.  Heywood recently participated in Joberg2C cycle race where he raised R100 000.  “This year I am afraid I am probably very unprepared because a month ago, I did a nine day cycle race from Johannesburg to Scottsburg, so I spent three months preparing for that. I have only ran 500 km in preparations. Comrades runners will probably be shocked by that, they say you need to do a 1000 km in preparation,” he said.  “Running Comrades is part of a plan to raise money, I am running a number of races, I will keep on putting myself through races until a million rand is raised. So, as soon as people give me the money or Section 27 gets the money as soon as possible to put me out of misery,” said Heywood.  He said R1m which was raised last year through the races was used to fix and repairs schools affected by protests in Vhuwani, Limpopo.  On Tuesday Heywood will be launching his memoir book titled, Get up, stand up which will be based in all the work he has done as an activists in the last 30 years.
