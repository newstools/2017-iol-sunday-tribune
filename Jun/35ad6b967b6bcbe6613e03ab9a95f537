UPDATE: Charismatic
chef David Higgs joins J’Something as judge on M-Net’s My Kitchen Rules
SA. Renowned restaurateur and award-winning South African chef David
Higgs, will be judging dishes alongside celebrity chef and musician J’Something
on M-Net’s sizzling new cooking reality show My Kitchen Rules SA! The straight-talking, no-nonsense Higgs has been in the culinary
world for more than two decades and is no stranger to television, having
appeared as a guest chef on more than one season of M-Net’s MasterChef South
Africa. Chef Higgs has previously won Restaurant of the Year as well as
Chef of the Year accolades, and currently owns Marble restaurant in Rosebank’s
Art Mile in Johannesburg. On being a judge on M-Net’s My Kitchen Rules, Higgs
revealed that it is all very exciting. “I love the format of the show and the fact that it offers the
viewer more than just cooking. I think the sense of drama and the emotions from
the teams will give the viewers lots to be entertained by. Although, I’m not
big into drama myself, so that will be interesting,” Higgs said. My Kitchen
Rules SA, which will
broadcast on M-Net later this year, promises to serve up all kinds of drama and
delectable dishes in some serious pressure-cooker settings around South Africa. But what will
one of South Africa’s most highly esteemed chefs be looking for from those who
enter the show? “This
competition is about team work for me. When one team member is down, it’s up to
the other one to pick up the pieces and vice versa – that is essentially what a
kitchen is all about. And, obviously, they need to be able to put good plates
of food together – consistently. It’s going to be fun to watch – so, fasten
your seatbelts,” said Higgs.
