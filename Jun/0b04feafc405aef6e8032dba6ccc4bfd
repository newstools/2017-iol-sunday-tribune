DURBAN - A Kwazulu-Natal man has captured a video of a pod of dolphins riding the waves of an eMdloti beach, north of Durban with a group of surfers. 
Richard Melvill whose video has been viewed more over 11 000 times on his Facebook page since he first shared it said he just happened to be at the right place at the right time.
Melvill, of eMdloti said he had gone to the beach on Saturday with his drone and stumbled upon the surfers riding the waves with the dolphins. It was an image he just had to capture. He said he regularly films the beach area but had never come across the sight of dolphins and surfers together.
He said the response to his video had been phenomenal.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
