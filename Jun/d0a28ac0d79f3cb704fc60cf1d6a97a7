The two-day event is hosted by the Xinhua News Agency under the theme “Deepening Brics Media Cooperation, Promoting Fair and Just International Public Opinion”. Durban-based photographer Motshwari Mofokeng was one of the speakers who addressed more than 20 delegates from more than a dozen media organisations in the member states – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Mofokeng, from the African News Agency pictures’ division, spoke about the important role photographers play in story-telling and bringing news to life through images and videos. “Our aim as photographers is to educate and inform the public through images. We are witnesses to incidents that they can only see if we capture them accurately,” he said. His work is among some of Independent Media’s work featured in the Brics Media Joint Photography Exhibition at the city’s National Museum of China. The exhibition highlights 170 images taken by photojournalists in Brics countries over the past few years. Mofokeng said he was honoured to be part of such a prestigious event and it motivated him to work even harder to constantly improve his craft. Member of the Politburo Standing Committee in China, Lui Yumshan, said it was important for the media in Brics member states to co-operate as that could only strengthen relations between their countries which would have positive impact on economic development. He said the media had the power to positively influence the public’s opinion on the Brics’ member states. “In terms of international public opinion, it is dominated by the West so it is important for the media in our countries to tell success stories so that we can also improve our presence in the media,” he concluded.  nokuthula.ntuli@inl.co.za  The Mercury
