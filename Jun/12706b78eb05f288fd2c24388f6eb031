Durban - Babes Wodumo has not travelled to the United States of America for her BET nomination. The West Ink Records team is hosting a media briefing in Durban to address reasons why the Best International: Africa nominated artist failed to make it to Los Angeles for her BET Awards nomination. She arrived at the Waterfront Hotel in Durban's Point-Waterfront with her beau Mampintsha, the head of the recording company. Sporting bright orange hair, the star was chatty with journalists but was in a sombre mood. The Sunday Tribune will broadcast the press briefing live on Facebook. @SundayTribuneSA Sunday Tribune
