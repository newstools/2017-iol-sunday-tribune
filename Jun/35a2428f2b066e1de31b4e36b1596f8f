JACK DANIEL’S BOOMTOWN Boomtown is possibly the biggest hospitality village at the Vodacom Durban July. It’s so big, that other companies, house their marquees in the village. And this year, it’s probably going to be their biggest VDJ, ever. And that’s just judging from the line-up, which is choc full of SA’s biggest performers, including Mafikizolo, AKA, Cassper Nyovest, Riky Rick, Nasty C, DJ Fresh and Durban’s Shekinah. As always, the celebrities will be milling about and with Vuzu AMP as one of the partners, it’s sure going to be the best marquee for those who love spotting their idols. Tickets go from R690 to R5 950, per person. GLENLIVET JAZZTOWN I never thought I would ever see a marquee dedicated to just jazz at the VDJ, but I see it has happened and I’m ecstatic. What I’m more ecstatic about, is the line-up: Hugh Masekela, Lira, and Tresor will be performing at the marquee. Honestly, with so many marquees having the same people performing, it’s a breathe of fresh air to get artists you generally wouldn’t see headlining at the VDJ. There will be a strong cuisine and beverage element at this marquee, where guests will get to enjoy pairings with the whiskey brand's various ranges. Tickets range from R3070 to R3990 per person. AFROTAINMENT MARQUEE  Listen. It doesn’t get more Durban than the Afrotainment Marquee, so if you want to hear the latest music from Durban, then this is the marquee for you. DJ Tira is once again promising to pull out the stops and has all his artists from Afrotainment performing at the marquee and the after party at Moses Mabhida Stadium in the evening on Saturday. Of course Babes Wodumo will perform, as will Big Nuz. Cassper Nyovest is also on the line-up and I'm looking forward to his collaboration with Babes and Mampintsha at the do. Oh and there will be a fashion show at the marquee, which is a great addition. Tickets go from R2000 to R4100 per person.
