This will be when the runners stabled in Durban give the public a final chance to see the horses in action at the Greyville racecourse before the main race on July 1. Last year’s winner, The Conglomerate, will be back in action, and jockey Callan Murray will fly back from Hong Kong to ride him, guests at Gold Circle’s lunchtime final field announcement and barrier draw were told yesterday. This year’s favourite, Edict of Nantes - winner of the Daily News 2000 - will be at the Gallops tomorrow, with his trainer Brett Crawford telling guests yesterday that it would be a chance for the horse to “stretch his legs”. Many of the big marquees are already up at Greyville as the countdown to the social event of the year draws closer. The theme this year is “The Colour of Magic”, which will influence the fashionistas, 
entrants in the fashion competitions and the decor in the marquees. And some fashion will be on show at the Gallops, which always attracts thousands of racing fans. The free coffee and sticky buns are also a lure for many. Daily News
