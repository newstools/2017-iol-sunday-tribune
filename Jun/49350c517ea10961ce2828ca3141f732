DURBAN- KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo has reacted with shock to the death of a paramedic who was killed near the gate of a hospital in Pietermaritzburg at the weekend. Sibusiso Mthethwa, was shot by unknown people near the gate at Edendale Hospital in Pietermaritzburg where he worked. The 36 year-old was shot last week Friday as he was leaving work, and died due to his injuries the following morning. “We are deeply shocked at the callousness of this incident. It is concerning that human life has become cheap to a point where criminals appear not to even think twice before snuffing away people’s lives,” Dhlomo said. The department had been robbed of a foot soldier he said. The father of five was stationed at an Emergency Medical Services bases at Mbali township near Pietermaritzburg. “Because of the cold-blooded actions of others, a family has lost a son, father and husband. We say condolences to his family, friends and colleagues. We hope that the perpetrators will be brought to book and subjected to the maximum legal sanction possible,” Dhlomo said. Daily News
