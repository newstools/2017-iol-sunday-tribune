Thundering hooves approaching down the home straight and the roar of an excited crowd is what keeps people coming back to horse racing at a time when many other institutions are fading away. This Saturday thousands will be at the Greyville racecourse for the Vodacom Durban July, most more interested in the fashion and champagne than the horses but still contributing to the spectacle of the country’s biggest lifestyle event. For a look ahead to the July weekend turn to pages 6 and 7 in the print edition. On race day the Tribune team will be there in force. Follow us on social media @sundaytribunesa #TribuneJuly. Inspired by this year’s Vodacom Durban July theme ‘The Colour of Magic’, actress, television presenter, model and fashion blogger Shashi Naidoo showcases Durban designer Kathrin Kidger’s collection during the Gateway Vodacom Durban July Preview Fashion Show and Concert at Gateway Hotel on Saturday.
