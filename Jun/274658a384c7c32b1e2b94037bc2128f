The laptops were donated by the Department of Tourism, sponsored by Amadeus, an IT service provider for the global travel and tourism industry, and Spanish airline Iberia, which flew the laptops free from Spain. More than 100 laptops were donated to different provinces: Gauteng received 13, Western Cape 15, while KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Limpopo, North West and Mpumalanga, all received 20. “Most of the incarcerated people here are young people, young people that we think have an opportunity to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society,” said Tourism Minister Tokozile Xasa, who unveiled the computer training facilities. Sarie Coetzee, 63, in prison for five years, is studying theology. She said the laptops would help her in writing notes and doing research. Belinda Nombuya, 29, said she had never used a computer before and was happy she now had the chance to build a career. - ANA
