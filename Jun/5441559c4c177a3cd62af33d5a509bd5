“Most of the guests were mine anyway, so I went to Sibaya and said: ‘Listen, I need the whole marquee’,” said Reddy, who is chairperson of Afrisun. He scotched suggestions that taking the marquee over was a cost-cutting exercise by Sibaya, saying that was a “totally wrong perception” and he had wanted the double-decker marquee to entertain more of his guests for his Edison Corporation. “Sibaya only had the top level for 250 guests anyway, as the bottom level was used by another organisation. I am now taking both the top and the bottom 
levels and entertaining 600 business guests.” The standard of the Edison Corporation’s race day hospitality would be the same as that of Sibaya’s. “It is going to be quality,” Reddy said. And yes, Miss South Africa - Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters - 
will put in an appearance as usual. Mo Magic, the magician, will also entertain to fit in with this year’s theme, “The colour of magic”. On the cost of playing host, Reddy said: “I don’t even want to tell you the figure: it is mind-boggling.” Greyville Racecourse is a hive of activity as preparations continue for the big race. Thirty marquees of different sizes have already gone up and the decor and accessories are expected to start arriving on Thursday. Edict of Nantes is the bookmaker’s favourite, while Al Sahem is in the number two slot. Daily News
