According to Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) two pupils from the school were dragged for several metres by the minibus taxi along Todd Street shortly before 8am. The taxi driver is alleged to have abandoned his vehicle and fled the scene on foot. A spokesman for Rusa said the taxi had allegedly been overtaking other vehicles when it hit into the two pupils. "Paramedics stabilised the critically injured boy and transported him to Osindsweni Hospital. He suffered a broken right leg, severe head injuries and a broken hip. According to witnesses, the taxi attempted to overtake several vehicles when he knocked into a group of children crossing the road. One student was thrown approximately 25 meters from the point of impact. A passing vehicle picked up one injured student and transported him to hospital privately," the Rusa spokesman said. No arrests had been made. Daily News
