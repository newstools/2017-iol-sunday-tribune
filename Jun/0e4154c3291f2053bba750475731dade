The mosque, situated on Dr Yusuf Dadoo and Denis Hurley streets, played its role during the Islamic month of Ramadaan by providing food and nutritional meals to hundreds of people. Being no stranger to mosques and religious sites in India, this was the second time the Consul-General of India in Durban, Dr Shashank Vikram, had visited the Grey Street Mosque. He was accompanied by Consul Santosh Rawat as they toured the mosque and walked along rows of people seated on the floor waiting to pray and then end their day of fasting with a meal. Muslims abstain from eating or drinking from sunrise to sunset during Ramadaan. “It is a very emotional experience to be in the house of God. There is a lot of warmth, serenity and peace inside these walls. I was inspired by the history behind the mosque, which was built by a person from India. The month of Ramadaan is sacred to the Muslim community and I am taken aback to have been invited to join them,” Vikram said. Ahmed Vally Mohamed, Grey Street Mosque chairperson, said during  Ramadaan more than 400 people arrived daily for a meal. The feeding scheme continues throughout the year at the mosque and the Denis Hurley Centre across the street.  The meals were co-sponsored by the Denis Hurley Centre and the consul-general of India.
