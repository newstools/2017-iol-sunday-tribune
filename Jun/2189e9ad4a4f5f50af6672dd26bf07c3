DURBAN - A 33-year old driver was killed after his car ploughed into a house in Escombe on Wednesday morning. It is alleged that the driver suffered a medical condition, causing him to lose control of his VW Polo and careen down an embankment.Â Garrith Jamieson, spokesman for Rescue Care, said the man died at the scene despite fervent attempts to resuscitate him. "The passenger who was in the car, was stabilised at the scene. She sustained moderate injuries and was rushed to a nearby hospital for further care," he said. The fatal crash comes just a short while after a 64-year old woman was assaulted during a robbery along the N2, near Lamontville. Jamieson stated that the car broke down at the side of the northbound carriageway. "The driver went to fetch petrol and the woman was assaulted by criminals who managed to break the car window with a brick. After robbing the woman, the men fled the scene," he added. Police are investigating both matters. Daily News
