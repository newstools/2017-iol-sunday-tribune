Durban â€“ Police shot dead an alleged car thief, wounded another and arrested two others during a night of high drama on the Berea. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a police spokesman, said officers were patrolling through Gordon Road in Berea at 6pm on Monday when they saw they spotted four men attempting to steal a car. "When the men saw police, they fled. One was arrested, while his three accomplices fled in their getaway car. Police gave chase from Berea area up to Durban CBD," he said. Police chased the alleged thieves through Berea with the men shooting at police as the cars weaved through traffic. Zwane said police fired back. The high-speed car chase eventually ended in the city centre with the alleged car thieves crashing their getaway vehicle. Garrith Jamieson, of Rescue Care, said the man shot in the abdomen, was in a serious condition. "He was stabilised at the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital for the further care that he required. Zwane said that two handguns were recovered. The men face charges of attempted car theft, attempted murder and possession of unlicensed firearm.
