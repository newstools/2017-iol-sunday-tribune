"In giving effect to and on the basis of the minister’s directive contained in the letter dated May 31, 2017, it was resolved that the resolution of the Board of Directors taken on May 2, 2017 is rescinded," the statement said. "Furthermore, it was resolved that the reinstatement agreement concluded between Mr. Molefe and Eskom on May 11, 2017 be rescinded." Eskom further confirmed that Molefe would no longer serve as a director on the power utility's board. IOL
