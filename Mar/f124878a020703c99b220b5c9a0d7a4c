“However, he faces some challenges, such as vulnerability to infection, which makes his condition unpredictable. “He remains hospitalised in Joburg,” Ahmed Kathrada Foundation spokesperson Neeshan Balton said on Saturday. Well-wishes continued to pour in on social media this week and the foundation set up a special Facebook page for the public to post their get well soon messages. “The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation thanks the public for its ongoing support. Among the many prayer initiatives, we would like to specifically thank Victoria Primary School in Tongaat. Pupils stood in the formation of the words ‘Get well soon Uncle Kathy’, which could be seen from the air. Initiatives like this go a long way in keeping us positive and hopeful that Mr Kathrada will fully recover,” said Balton. On Human Right’s Day this week, an interfaith prayer was held for Kathrada at Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, once the nerve centre of the liberation movement. Kathrada, a tireless activist for non-racialism and constitutionalism, is one of three Rivonia triallists still alive, along with Andrew Mlangeni and Denis Goldberg.  nabeelah.shaikh@inl.co.za  Sunday Tribune
