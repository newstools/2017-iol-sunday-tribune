Set to run at Sibaya’s iZulu Theatre in March, Boomgaard will once again show off his unique and witty take on a range of topics from politics and medical aid schemes to relationships, car guards and all the juicy bits in between. “Having recently ended a successful round of comedy with shows; My Funny Valentine and Those Muslim Guys, I am looking forward to riding this one solo. Also, this will help to prepare me and keep me in form ahead of my Australia tour in April and USA tour later in the year,” he said. “In Joker, I’ll be poking fun at everything under the sun. The audience can expect to hear about credit card debt, how to deal with traffic jams, those pesky call centre agents and a topic all women love to hear (and men cringe at) overbearing mothers,” added Boomgaard. Joker has something for everyone and officers a combination of rapid fire one liners and more elaborate story-styled jokes. Boomgaard is celebrating his tenth year in comedy and Joker will be recorded on DVD. So ladies make sure that your hair is on fleek. * Joker will be staged at iZulu Theatre at Sibaya on March 24 and 25 at 8pm. Tickets are R100 and are available from Computicket and Checkers.
