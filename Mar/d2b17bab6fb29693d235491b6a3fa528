Durban – Police have offered a R250 000 reward for the
safe return of a missing one month old Durban baby. The one month old went missing on Friday morning when her
mother’s Yaris was stolen near the Game City shopping centre. The car was later
recovered in Montclair, but the baby was not there nor was there damage to the
car. On Saturday morning, KwaZulu-Natal police spokersperson
Major Thulani Zwane told the Sunday Tribune that police were offering a reward
of up to R250 000 for the safe return of the baby. “A reward of up to R250 000 is offered to anyone who may
provide with information that will lead to the recovery of a baby and the
arrest and conviction of the suspects. More than 100 police officers assisted
by community and other role players are deployed now to search for the baby,”
said Zwane. This brings the sum total for the return of the baby girl to R270 000, after an anonymous caller on East Coast Radio offered
R10 000 - which was duly matched by radio jock Phat Joe. On Saturday morning, the Sunday Tribune has confirmed
search for the baby was continuing in Greyville and at Cato Manor with police
search and rescue, police K9 unit, paramedics and members of the community
involved. Zwane said the search continued well into the night in
the early hours of Saturday. He confirmed social media rumours which claimed the baby
had been found were false. Police were meeting with the baby’s father, Felokwakhe
Mbambo, at the Durban Central Police Station on Saturday morning. More to follow. Follow @SundayTribuneSA
