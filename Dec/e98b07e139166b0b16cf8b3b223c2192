The bodies were of a 5-year-old child and a 25-year-old woman. Last night, a resident in the area noticed blood on a pathway leading to a bush at the Seatides circle on the M4 highway and immediately alerted police.

On Tuesday morning, CERT member, Nazir Sadack, visited the scene and explained how police followed a bloody path to scene of the grave where the child was buried beneath the woman.

Both the woman and child were suspected to have died from blunt force trauma to their heads. “As were we digging, we moved the adult and noticed a T-shirt underneath and discovered the child. It was absolutely sad, as a dad your heart just sinks when you see another child in that condition,” Sadack said. Sadack said the murders were believed to have been committed hours before their finding of the graves, SAPS spokesperson, Major Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident. He said: "Two counts of murder were opened for further investigation, up to now there's been no arrests made.”Police are yet to identify the adult and child, and are currently searching for missing people in the area.
