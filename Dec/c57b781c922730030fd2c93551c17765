Tsele and her friends allege that Ndaba, from Durban, assaulted Tsele with his fists and slammed her into a wall, breaking her tooth. Ndaba and his cousin, known only as Qhawe, had been drinking at a Braamfontein apartment with a group of women when he allegedly assaulted the young woman. The woman was arguing with one of her four friends when Ndaba intervened. The two also fought over a bottle of alcohol when Ndaba drank Tsele’s vodka, which had been kept for her birthday this month. Court Police spokesperson Sergeant Mduduzi Zondo said Ndaba is due to appear at the Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court tomorrow. “The suspect was arrested on Thursday night and an investigation went on the whole night and he was 
eventually released on warning in the early hours of Friday. “The suspect will make his first appearance at the Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court on Monday,”  said Zondo. Tsele refused to comment this week, saying her family has advised her not to speak with the media any longer. Ndaba, on the other hand, released a statement saying he had returned to Joburg to “co-operate with the police regarding the matter”. “Inasmuch as this has affected me negatively, but let us please let our South African law handle the matter rightfully. I plead with TeamMthokozisi and everyone to not attack the complainant on social media,” he said. He called on his followers to take a stand against violence against women and children abuse. Ndaba lost the Idols 2017 competition to Cape Town’s Paxton Fielies and stormed off the stage, ditching a planned media conference.  siphelele.buthelezi@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
