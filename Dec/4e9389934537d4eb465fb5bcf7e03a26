Thabani Khumalo said DA politics in the province was “boring because of the lack of the contestation”.  Mncwango, who dislodged his nemesis Sizwe Mchunu in 2015, had previously told the Sunday Tribune he would stand for a second term. This raised the ire of Mchunu, who said it was a lack of maturity for a party leader to be talking about the congress when the nominations had not been opened.   The DA was expected to hold its KZN provincial congress in February, before its national congress in April.  At least 600 delegates were expected to attend.  Support The Sunday Tribune has learnt that some were lobbying for Mchunu to challenge Mncwango but he had not accepted their request as yet.  Khumalo said: “The DA lost vibrancy when Mchunu was defeated by Mncwango. Now the DA politics is dull because Mncwango is mainly focusing on eThekwini where he leads his party’s caucus.” The DA in KZN was divided by the old guard, which supported Mchunu and consisted of people like MP Dianne Kohler-Barnard and others, while Mncwango enjoyed the support of the new guard such as MPLs Mbali Ntuli and Hlanganani Gumbi.  This youthful flock was believed to be backing party leader Mmusi Maimane.  Khumalo said: “It seems the congress will be a one-horse race. One would expect that at this stage we should know who will challenge Mncwango.” In October, Bonginkosi Madikizela, perceived as Helen Zille’s close ally, was elected Western Cape leader.  Last month, John Moodley retained his position as DA leader in Gauteng.  Khumalo said it would be “suicidal" for the DA in KZN not to have a black leader.  The DA, which had been making inroads in predominantly black areas, had reached the ceiling among white voters, he added. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
