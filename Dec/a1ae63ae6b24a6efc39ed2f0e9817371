Davido’s management said the musician would be performing in his home country instead in a government- backed gig and could not turn down the Nigerian government as it had always supported him. Event organiser Mthokozisi “DJ Tira” Khathi confirmed that Davido would not be jetting into Durban and local rapper AKA would replace him. Khathi said the party would go ahead, despite the late cancellation. “Fact Durban Rocks has never needed international acts to sell out. Local artists have done this for the last seven years and this year will be no different. This year we wanted to book someone who was popular with our fans and to say thank you for all the support, we wanted to unite Africa through music,” said Khathi. This year’s Fact Durban Rocks will have an array of local stars including Black Coffee and Somizi Mhlongo. Meanwhile, the new lady in the Afrotainment music stable, Tipcee, real name Thobeka Ndaba, will perform at Fact Durban Rocks for the first time. Ndaba is the vocalist on the Distruction Boyz’s Madness song and features on Afrotainment’s compilation, Afro Summer 17. She has been compared to Babes Wodumo, who exploded on to the music scene in 2016. Speaking to the Sunday Tribune this week, Ndaba said it was exciting to attend Fact Durban Rocks not as a fan, but as a performer. “I feel like a big star as I will be performing in front of a huge crowd. This is a big one for me. “It has not been an easy journey, I have been trying to make it since 2009 with the group Chaos. We broke up and I went solo. My big break only came this year,” she said. In Richards Bay, the Last Dance Music Festival will take place at the uMhlathuze Sports Complex, where Mi Casa will perform. Event organiser Sipho Ndaba said more than 20000 people were expected to be part of the event, which has Amanda Black, Cassper Nyovest, Babes Wodumo, Khuzani and Oskido as headline artists. The Last Dance and Fact Durban Rocks parties will be broadcast live on SABC 1. See Page 11
