DURBAN - Westville Prison inmates are in for a treat this year for their Christmas feast.   The prison head for the women’s section confirmed that warders and entrusted inmates would be making delicious food for the prisoners.  Ntombifuthi Mkhize, head of the women’s prison, said the day would start with a church service for those who would be responsible for preparing Christmas lunch.  The lunch will be served as per normal during prison lunch hours and all prisoners will enjoy the treat.  Mkhize said cooks used the existing food supplies but warders contributed small amounts to buy extras the government did not make available to inmates.  But what’s on the menu?  “This year our menu is roast chicken, rice with vegetables to add creativity, butternut with cinnamon spice and braised cabbage. Donuts will be served for dessert with alcohol-free punch,” explained Mkhize. Inmate Smangele Njoko, 41, is one of the inmates who will be preparing the Christmas feast for the prisoners. Njoko, who helps in the kitchen throughout the year, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for murdering her husband.
