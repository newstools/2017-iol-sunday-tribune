The opening of a satellite police station on the hostel’s grounds, where the national intervention and public order policing units will be stationed, has done little to endear police to residents.  Residents' scepticism stems from their belief that some police officers have been involved in violent crime at the hostel. At least 100 people have been killed at Glebelands since March 2014. Hostel residents, including those who testified before the Moerane commission, have alleged that some police officers orchestrated criminal acts there. While the residents commended the police for the arrest of six men on Thursday, including a policeman, many said they would wait to see if justice took its course.  “We have seen more police driving around and patrolling on foot, but it will take time to trust them. A lot of people died while the police were patrolling in the past, so how do we know things have changed this time?” said a mother of two who has lived at the hostel for 12 years. Another resident said there had been only one conviction in relation to all the murders, so the SAPS would have to prove themselves. “All we see is them arresting illegal liquor traders instead of finding the killers who are giving us sleepless nights. They need to strengthen their intelligence and get rid of rogue policemen if they genuinely want to stop the killings here.  “The cop who was arrested will probably be released on Monday, so that’s nothing to get excited about. We want to see people serving sentences,” said another hostel dweller. Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said progress was being made in the murder investigations in spite of the difficulties encountered.  “Obstacles include reluctant and missing witnesses, witnesses being killed, the community’s negative perceptions and information dissemi-
nated on various public platforms that keeps suspects a step ahead of police,” he said.  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
