The event is planned for the Moses Mabhida Stadium and  is open to the public free.  The public will have an opportunity to understand all the duties of the metro police and also learn about the unit's history as the first unit in the country after the metropolitan municipalities were formed. Metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said there would be a lot of activities including the demonstrations of various police units to showcase their capabilities.  “We will start our day with the motorcade from the Silver Sands on the beachfront through the OR Tambo Parade to the stadium. People on the beach will be able to watch the motorcade and they are welcome to join us at the stadium,” he said. Sewpersad said there were a lot of services that metro police rendered other than issuing traffic fines. On the day, all facilities would be there and those who wish to check or pay their fines would be allowed to do so. “We not only arrest and issue fines, but we help residents a lot. For those who wish to join the metro police, we will have all the information available.  "Our various units will be doing the demonstration for people to understand how we work. “During our recent recruitment, we received more than 40000 applications. Unfortunately, we currently have only 800 vacancies to be filled. Two hundred successful applicants would be employed soon, a further 200 in February and the same number in August and February 2019,” he added.  The metro police day will coincide with the launch of the festive season programme by the city's festive season management committee.   siboniso.mngadi@inl.co.za    SUNDAY TRIBUNE
