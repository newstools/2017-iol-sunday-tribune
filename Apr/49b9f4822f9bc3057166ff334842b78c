NABEELAH SHAIKH A BRITISH muezzin – who gives the adhan or call to prayer – was in Durban this week to teach locals how to perfect their recitation. Hafiz Adam Ghodawala, who memorised the Qur'an and became a reciter at the Islamic Dawah Academy in Leicester, is also a manager at Haramain Recordings, which has operated since 2006, supported by imams of the Great Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. On his first trip to South Africa, aiming to raise awareness of the call to prayer, he visited mosques in uMhlanga, Merebank, Overport, Asherville and Pietermaritzburg as part of his Echoes of Haramain tour, organised by Channel Islam International. He is trying to teach imams the art of perfecting the recitation of the adhan, which is rendered five times a day throughout the world. “The call to prayer needs to be done beautifully and melodiously. When people hear the music, it must appeal  to them, much like the adhan needs to draw people to prayer,” said Ghodawala. He said people often embraced Islam as they loved the sound of the adhan. Ghodawala has recited the adhan in mosques globally, including in Mecca and Medina. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
