DURBAN - THE Durban High Court has granted the DA a court interdict preventing Durban mayor Zandile Gumede from inciting violence and using law enforcement to arrest protesters at Friday's #AntiZumaMarches set to take place in Durban and around the country. The protests are being held to call for the resignation of President Jacob Zuma who last week sacked finance minister Pravhin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas. On Monday, credit rating agency S&P downgraded the country to junk status, citing political instability. Gumede reportedly referred to the imminent protests as acts of treason and was calling on police to effect arrests. DA KwaZulu-Natal leader Zwakele Mncwango said: "This is a victory for the constitutionally enshrined right to protest peacefully, and for the democratic principles that underpin our hard-won Constitutional Democracy".  Meanwhile, Gumede refuted the claims in a statement earlier on Thursday. Her spokesman, Mthunzi Gumede, said: "Gumede ,refutes the claims that she will unleash all security agencies to those participating on the march in Durban against President Jacob Zuma. "Yesterday (Wednesday), during the AFUS summit, Mayor Gumede called on those who want to march in “support” or “against” President Zuma to follow the proper procedures and apply with authorities. The wide published sensationalized comments by various news agencies are total fabrication and distortion of her public message. We call on all news agencies to immediately retract and withdraw the story," they said.   INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY
