DURBAN - President Jacob Zuma’s cabinet, which is glaringly dominated by Nguni people, might mark the end of the ruling party’s reign if it is not remedied, according to political analysts. Zulus, Xhosas, Ndebeles and Swazis all fall under the Nguni tribe and they are predominantly found in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. “The ANC always prides itself (on being) a non-racial organisation, but the low number of minorities in the cabinet and the dominance of Ngunis is concerning,” said political analyst Protas Madlala. While the ANC boasts a membership of more than 700 000 people, the party is voted for by millions. Of the nine provinces, the ANC controls all but the Western Cape, which is run by the DA. Of the 72 ministerial and deputy portfolios in the cabinet, at least 39 are occupied by Nguni people, with the rest shared among other tribes. Madlala said the campaign to challenge Ramaphosa's claim to the presidency was also a bone of contention. “The party should stand by its tradition that the deputy president should succeed the president,” said Madlala. “I know it's a tradition, not a policy. But this is the same tradition that Zuma relied on to become president,” he added. Madlala said this begged the question whether Ramaphosa was being challenged because he is a Venda. He also expressed his concerns about the number of whites and Indians in the cabinet, saying they were too low. Malusi Gigaba, who is a Nguni, replaced fired finance minister Pravin Gordhan – a move that, according to Madlala, proved the dominance of the Ngunis in Zuma’s cabinet. But Madlala said Zuma inherited the trend from his predecessors, Thabo Mbeki and Nelson Mandela. All ANC state presidents after 1994, excluding Kgalema Motlanthe, are from the Nguni tribe. Another analyst, Xolani Dube of the Xubera Institute for Research and Development, said South Africa has not gone beyond the politics of tribal groups. “This is what characterises African politics.” SUNDAY TRIBUNE
