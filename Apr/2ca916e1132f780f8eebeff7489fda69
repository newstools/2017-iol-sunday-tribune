Carla Borges had shared a decade-long friendship with the deceased and had planned to scatter the ashes along the South Coast. But she was left fuming when a Phoenix funeral home delivered the ashes in a Shoprite packet. The deceased had been living with Borges and died two weeks ago. Borges said she had expected the ashes to be contained in a wooden urn - certainly not in a packet. She said the family had cremated dead pet dogs before and they had been treated better.
