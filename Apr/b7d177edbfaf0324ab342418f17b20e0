Transnet Property chief executive Thabo Lebelo, who along with government officials, conducted a site inspection earlier this week, said that while the warehouse was being leased by another company, the property was owned by Transnet. It was unclear what materials were stored at the property, he said. “What happened in the shed and the condition of the fire suppression system will be a part of the investigation. I am not in a position to speculate as to the condition of the system, but as the owner of the shed, the responsibility of making sure that it works rests with us,” said Lebelo. The South Durban Community Environmental Alliance hosted a series of meetings to address community concerns and issues surrounding health impacts, damage to property, and an emergency plan for south Durban. Residents called for a full and independent investigation into the cause of the fire and for accountability from the eThekwini Municipality and Transnet. They commended firefighters for extinguishing the blaze that raged for three days. South Durban Community Environmental Alliance researcher and co-ordinator Shanice Gomez said it was fortunate that the fire had not spread. “Next time things could be different. This time the wind carried the fumes away,” Gomez said. “Even so there were health risks from inhaling the fumes and people’s health suffered as a result. We need to make sure as civil society that our city is prepared. We are concerned that the city’s emergency plan is inadequate and outdated. “Factories and warehouses are built too close to residential areas. These and other environmental and social concerns surrounding the port development and industrial expansion should be discussed with the residents,” she said. Sunday Tribune
