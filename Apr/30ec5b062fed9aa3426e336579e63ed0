STAFF REPORTER BUSINESSWOMAN Sue Moodley’s
credentials as someone who knows no bounds when it comes to improving
the lives of others, is well established.Moodley, 35, a former
KZN resident who now lives in Joburg, will be up against 14 other
contestants vying to be crowned Mrs Commonwealth, later this
year.The winner of the competition will be decided through an
online voting process.The pageant, which is in its second year of
existence is aimed at honouring South African women who are committed
to upliftment of the needy and less fortunate.Moodley is the
mother of two and the owner of two businesses geared towards
providing low-cost housing.But Moodley’s kindheartedness
extends beyond providing shelter for the impoverished, she is also
committed to caring for breast cancer patients.Fighting cancer
has become a personal matter for Moodley.A few years ago, her
mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and there was little that
could be done to help her because the disease was detected too late,
and had already spread to all her major organs.“This inspired
me to get involved with the “Pink” mobile breast check units, as
well as contributing towards six educational cars. These units travel
into rural and urban areas around the country and enable
disadvantaged communities to access diagnostic mammography screening,
education, physical examinations, and teach people how to do breast
self-examinations,” she saidHer cancer initiatives steered her
towards the Mrs Commonwealth  pageant which she hopes to use  to help
cancer sufferers. Moodley plans to dedicate six months of this year
to preparing for the pageant.“I will be taking six months off
work, which seems risky given the fact that I have businesses to run
and employees to pay, but it is something I have to do in memory of
my dead mother.“It hasn’t been an easy decision to make but
I’ve spoken to my family and colleagues and they have given me
their support.“I am a very ambitious person but, regardless of
whether I win or not, it’s all about making a difference.“Some
people have asked me what is the difference is between and Mrs
Commonwealth and Mrs South Africa and I say Mrs Commonwealth is
beauty with a cause.” Moodley has planned a “high tea” for
some of the country’s leading ladies on May 20 and all the proceeds
from the event, held at the Faire Lawn Hotel and Spa in Sandton, will
go towards the Pink Drive.To vote for Moodley, SMS “Sue
Moodley” to 35554, all messages cost R3 and proceeds will also go
to the Pink Drive. #@SUNDAY TRIBUNE
