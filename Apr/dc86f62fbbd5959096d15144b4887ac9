Durban: A Durban NGO hopes its latest fund-raiser on Saturday will wipe out debt of R220 000, mainly in veterinary bills. The Phoenix Animal Care and Treatment (Pact) centre has rescued, treated, rehabilitated and found homes for more than 12 000 animals in its five-year existence. Now facing closure, the centre hopes a planned Doggy Walk at 10am (register from 8.30am) and Family Fun Day at La Lucia GrowthPoint Park will provide a lifeline. There will be a 3km fun walk, jumping castles, face-painting, a carnival, food stalls, pet education stalls, micro-chips and interaction with dogs to adopt. Deshnee Govender, a volunteer at the centre, said: “We deal with severe cases that require special treatment only vets can provide – and that’s expensive. Without funding the animals can’t be treated.” Transport was another expense. “Poverty is rife in parts of Phoenix and some owners can’t afford to sterilise their pets. We sterilise animals and help the needy,” said Govender. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
