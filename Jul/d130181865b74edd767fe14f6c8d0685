Durban - Rural horse racing, leisure fashion and good times were the order of the day at the Dundee July 2017 held on Saturday.
Despite the extremely windy conditions, everyone who attended the event seemed determined to make the most of it. Now in its 13th year, this rural horse racing spectacle has grown in leaps and bounds. Among the mix of attendees was the MEC for Arts and Culture, Bongi Sithole-Moloi, who said she was focused on ensuring that this year’s event showed improvement from the last. “We focused on identifying our weaknesses which included security, traffic control and infrastructure upgrade. “This year we also extended the rural horse-riding programme to all districts, including Nkandla, Pietermaritzburg, Ladysmith, Nquthu, eDumbe, Harry Gwala and Amajuba,” said Sithole-Moloi. “We are confident that the event has moved to the next level and will grow even bigger in years to come,” she said. The crowd, who were mostly locals, came out in their numbers to support their favourite jockeys and get a glimpse of some serious fashion. The KZN Fashion Council this year mentored a few designers who showcased some spectacular low-cost designs. The term “low cost” shouldn’t detract from the hard work involved in the process of designing, sewing and showcasing their brands. This year, the theme for the fashion aspect was Afro leisure, and the designers attacked the task with enthusiasm. The combination of elements of Africa and leisure were showcased in an eye-catching array of garments. In the categories for Best Dressed Male and Best Ensemble, Utrecht designer Jabulile Tshabalala emerged victorious. The Best Dressed Female award went to Zandile Masando for her flamboyant outfit. In keeping with expanding the event, more designers were added to the showcase list as compared to last year’s event. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
