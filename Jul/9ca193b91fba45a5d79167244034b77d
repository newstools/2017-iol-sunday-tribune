While Mpisane petitioned for a good man, some people among the crowd said it looked like Sbahle, 24, already had a “man” as she looked glowing. “As I have done uMemulo for my eldest daughter, Sbahle, she can now date officially,” said Mpisane. “I want a principled, confident husband to marry her and look after her.” Sbahle’s younger sister, Tumi, said she was proud of her sister and wished her all the best. “She taught me to be independent and not to allow people to bully me,” she said. Sbahle’s coming of age ceremony was attended by First Lady Thobeka Madiba-Zuma and Minnie Dlamini’s mother, Queen, who was seen attaching some money to her hat. It was an invitation-only affair attended by about 150 guests who took turns to gift Sbahle with money on her hat or umbrella. There were traditional performances from groups hired to entertain guests and from her friends, who were by her side as is part of tradition. Dlamini’s mother’s presence drew some wandering eyes, as both Sbahle and 
Minnie have dated Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune. A traditional Zulu meal,  curry, plus  desserts were served to the guests. Expensive spirits flowed and the guests partied into the night at the after-party which took place after the traditional festivities.
