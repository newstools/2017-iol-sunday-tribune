Durban - Three men had to be rescued when their ski boat experienced engine failure on Wednesday afternoon. Paul Herbst, spokesperson for IPSS Medical Rescue, said the boat was launched from the Tinley Manor Club earlier in the day. "The men aboard were out fishing when the boat suffered engine failure. They returned to Tinley using the remaining motor. Whilst circling waiting for a safe opportunity to beach, a wave capsized the vessel," he said. All three men managed to swim to safety and the boat washed onto the rocks. The boat broke up.  IPSS Rescue, KDM Lifeguards and Fire dept and SAPS K9 Search and Rescue recovered the boat and some equipment. SAPS S&R are en route with lift bags to conduct a dive operation to recover the motors. Luckily no one was injured.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
