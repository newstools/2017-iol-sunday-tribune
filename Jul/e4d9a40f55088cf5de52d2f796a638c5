BMW is carrying out a service campaign to check the R1200 GS and R1200 GS Adventure model motorcycles. Critical driving conditions cannot be ruled out, BMW Motorrad South Africa said about the 1 600 of them in the country. Owners of the affected motorcycles will be informed by BMW Motorrad South Africa of the service campaign, which will be carried out countrywide.&nbsp;All authorised BMW Motorrad dealers are equipped to carry out the check and repairs, the company said. The service campaign is free of charge and all affected customers are encouraged to contact their nearest authorised dealer as soon as possible. &nbsp;BMW said it had determined, during ongoing field observations, that the fixed fork tube of the specified models could suffer preliminary damage under certain circumstances, when high stress could occur without the customer noticing the damage.&nbsp; Such high stress can be caused, for example, when riding over an obstacle in the road, during a fall or when riding through deep potholes with unvarying speed. There may not be any visible damage to the front wheel. However, any severe impact should be checked by an authorised BMW Motorrad dealer. Potential preliminary damage to the fixed fork tube manifests itself through a gap between the pipe and the pressed-in top seal plugs, which can be seen if the rubber grommet is moved down the stanchion. If the fit of the pressed-in seal plug has become loose, the gap may increase through longer usage and where the vehicle experiences high-stress situations. This usually results in oil leaks, a clacking noise as well as increasingly imprecise steering. If these signals are not observed or are ignored and further high-stress incidents occur, the plug may become completely loose. &nbsp;THE INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY&nbsp;
