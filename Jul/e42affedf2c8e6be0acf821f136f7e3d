DURBAN: Two Durban school choirs have returned home with a clutch of gold medals after their winning performances in international choral competitions.
St Mary’s Diocesan School for Girls in Kloof won two gold medals at the 10th International Johannes Brahms Choir Festival and competition, which was held in Wernigerode, central Germany. Kearsney College in Botha’s Hill won the folksong category in the 10th Orientale Concentus International Choral Festival, which was held Singapore. Kearsney also beat hundreds of other school choirs from around the world by scoring well in the equal voices-youth category, earning a second gold at the event. St Mary’s won its gold medals for performances in the folklore and the pop-show-jazz categories. It also received the audience’s favourite choir award and the jury’s award for the most entertaining choir. “We are so proud of our girls and their teachers. What a team,” said Jonathan Manley, executive principal of St Mary’s. Manley attributed the choir’s success to many hours of hard work and numerous performances in preparation for the international competition. “Before we go on stage, I tell the girls to show their enthusiasm and passion on their faces, to interact and to enjoy,” the school’s head of music and choir conductor Lindy van der Meulen said of St Mary’s success secret.  nokuthula.ntuli@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
