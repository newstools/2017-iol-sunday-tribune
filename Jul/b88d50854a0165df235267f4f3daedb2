THE digital radio personality and media personality Tbo Touch has been roasted for a tweet where he suggested one's "mental disposition" was the only difference between success and a life of poverty on the streets. Tbo Touch, whose real name is Thabo Molefe, was roasted by the Black Twitter faithful who said they were hurt by his inference. Tbo Touch, who heads up the digital radio station, Touch HD, had tweeted late on Tuesday evening: "The only difference between the guy I just drove pass begging in streets and myself is our mental disposition. Let's change how we THINK".   The "deep fakeness" of this tweet is about as fake as your twang. — VUYA (@AvuyAva) July 18, 2017  Please delete this. It sounds like privilege. It's nauseating and very aloof. Please check it out. And you know I got your back! — Manqoba Ngubo (@manqoba_ngubo) July 18, 2017   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
