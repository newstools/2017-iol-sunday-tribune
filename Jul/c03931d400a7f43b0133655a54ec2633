DURBAN: DO YOU want to know where to tuck into the best paneer in India, secure a stunning pair of designer shoes in London or find other information while travelling?
A Pietermaritzburg businesswoman may have the answers to such questions, delivered to the palm of your hand. Nafeesa Joosab has launched her own app called Shop Eat Sleep worldwide, inspired by her travel frustrations. Tired of sharing shopping tips with friends and family, she decided to make her know-how available to the world. She conceptualised Shop Eat Sleep and launched the app at the Haute Events fashion show in uMhlanga this week. The app is meant to help travellers and is available free on Android and iPhone devices. “I was at a molecular gastronomy restaurant in Dubai after New Year, having dinner with a close friend from Delhi. We were discussing my concept, which was initially a guide book, when he suggested the app, which was how the idea was born. "I looked up app companies in Durban and came across Kagiso Interactive, based in uMhlanga. They produced my app within three months,” said Joosab. She is recruiting people around the world to get involved with her venture. “I am inviting other fashionistas and travellers to upload information. There will be knowledgeable local people in each country who can update information on the app. I’ve already secured London, Australia, India, Doha and South Africa,” said Joosab. She said her plan was to grow the app’s worldwide footprint.  nabeelah.shaikh@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
