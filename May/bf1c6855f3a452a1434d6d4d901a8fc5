DURBAN: An eManzimtoti fraud suspect who allegedly helped herself to millions of rand from local businesses by posing as a Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) official will remain behind bars at the Westville prison until May 15. Michayla Kogie Mentoor, 48, appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crime Court, today, for formal bail application, but the matter was remanded for the state to prepare further evidence. Mentoor was arrested, last month, at a plush Cape Town estate after being on the run for several months. The court heard today that Mentoor had two other previous convictions for fraud and was in breach of judgement in one of the cases, which carried a suspended sentence. The Hawks also confirmed a warrant of arrest was issued for Mentoor at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court in 2013, after similar allegations with potential losses of more than R60 million. State prosecutor Wendy O’ ’Brien was opposed to bail and argued that Mentoor was accused of a schedule five offence. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
