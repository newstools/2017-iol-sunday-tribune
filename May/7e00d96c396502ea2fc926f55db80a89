DURBAN - The low point of the World Economic Forum on Africa must have been watching the 93-year-old president of Zimbabwe waking up momentarily from his dreamy slumber to state that the former breadbasket of Africa that has become its beg basket was not a poor and fragile state. The biggest disappointment for me was learning that the iconic Moses Mabhida Stadium SkyCar was out of service this week. Anyway, after rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous and the learned for three days I left the conference still poor – but filthy rich by Zim standards – and still optimistic about our country and continent. We may be taking our time, but Africans are surely rising (see pages 6, 7 and 18 in the press edition on Sunday morning). I know anger is also rising in this country and continent, but happy Africa Month everyone. It’s been 20 days since Palestinians in Israeli prisons embarked on their “empty stomach” strike. Today marks the 21st. See page 11 for views from both sides of the divide who will not budge. Did you know there’s a connection between Durban and the famous King Solomon’s Mines and related “lost world” literature and movie genre that has captivated people’s imagination around the world for decades? We’re highly indebted to two local historians for telling the fascinating story (see page 17). Part of the rising anger in our country has to do with the coming ANC elective conference in December. Professor George Devenish argues that there is a need for an informed discourse about the options we have (page 18). On page 21, feminist activist and writer Gillian Schutte claims it would be a turning point if Lindiwe Sisulu joined the presidential race – officially, that is. Would other women support her?
