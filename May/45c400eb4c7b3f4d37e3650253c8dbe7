DURBAN – DUT female students are tired of feeling vulnerable, fearing they may also fall victim the same way other young women around the country have become victims of violence. More importantly, they want police to be out in their numbers protecting them – in the same way that dozens of police arrive when students strike or protest. More than 250 students marched on Friday from the Steve Biko Campus in Berea to King Dinizulu’s Park (Botha’s Park), where they then joined the KZN ANCYL protesting violence against women. “We are tired of the violence we are surrounded by. We hear of young women who are abducted, raped, and killed by the men who are supposed to protect them and care for them. “As the student representative council, we hear of cases of violence against other female students, and we cannot stay silent on this,” said Zama Mncube, president of DUT’s student representative council (SRC).

Mncube said women were living in fear, and that not all men were trash. “Our communities see violence, we need intervention, the silence from the city in protecting us is too loud. The police come in large numbers when we are protesting, but we want them to protect us from violence,” she said. Mlu Ntombela the representative from council, said the matters would be raised with the mayor. “Our responsibility is to make sure you are safe. From here I will take your concerns to the executive committee for decisions to be made,” said Ntombela. Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo fronted the ANC march and urged women to report crimes against them. Students gathered at the march in the Durban CBD on Friday.
