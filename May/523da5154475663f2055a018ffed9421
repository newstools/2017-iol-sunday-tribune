DURBAN - THE police have nabbed a 30-year-old man who had been on the run from the police after the murder of 19-year-old Asanda Mbuyazi, who was killed last week after she went missing two days earlier.  Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said the arrests were made by the Richards Bay Organised Crime unit who tracked the suspect to the Ingwavuma area where he was hiding.  Mbuyazi was living with albinism and had gone missing on Wednesday last week before her naked body was found in bushes at the Ndlabeyilandula area in KwaMbonambi, two days later.  "She had stab wounds on her body and without her underwear which made police to suspect that she was raped. A case of rape and murder was opened at KwaMbonambi police station," said Zwane.  "The members were looking for the suspect immediately after a murder case was opened at the KwaMbonambi police station. He will be charged with rape and murder and will appear in the KwaMbonambi Magistratesâ€™ Court soon," said Zwane.  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
