The third annual Zakifo Music Festival, is set to feature a multi-genre line-up like no other. Held at Durban’s Blue Lagoon Beach, this year's festival has more than 30 international artists on it programme, from the United Kingdom, the USA, Jamaica and even Niger. Festival goers can expect to be entertained by Damian Marley, Ray Phiri, the Nova Twins and many more. Zakifo, which was was started by Jerome Galabert, Sipho Sithole and Andy Davis, is a member of Igoda which is a music festival circuit that includes Sakifo Festival, Azgo Festival in Maputo, Bassline Africa Day concert, and Bushfire Festival in Swaziland. These festivals happen over a period of three weeks and have created an artist and festival goer touring circuit in the Southern African region. Galabert, who is the festival’s director, said that Zakifo means “what is needed” in Creole. “With Zakifo in Durban our intention is the same. We want to answer the call of the city’s creative voices; strengthening ties between the cultural communities of the Indian Ocean, from India to Australia to China and of course Reunion, Madagascar and Mauritius. Through our world-class line-up we strive to inspire and create lasting opportunities for collaboration; cross cultural exchanges; economic opportunities and skills development.” "This partnership with Reunion Islands has been a dream of mine. I have attended a number of music festivals internationally and there was no better choice and fit than Zakifo to bring to South Africa, particularly my home town and province. Zakifo is a destination festival, a people to people encounter and we guarantee you that over the years this festival will become part of traveler's' annual calendar coming from all over the world,” he said. Other artists to look forward to include Petite Noir, Bongesiwe Mabandla, Thandiswa Mazwai and Birdy Nam Nam. Tickets are on sale through Computicket and include a general access and VIP options. The festival takes place from 26 - 28 May.
