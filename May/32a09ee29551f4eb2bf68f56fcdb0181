DURBAN – THE teacher, accused of sexting his teenage pupil, was granted bail in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. He was granted R6000 bail. The matter was thrust into the spotlight two weeks ago when the girl's father found messages between the 33-year old man and his 14-year old daughter. The pair had allegedly began messaging each other in September. The girl was 13 at the time. The teacher is a well-known playwright and poet and the matter has gripped communities across the greater Durban area. Despite journalists being allowed in court for the accused’s first and second appearance, the formal bail application was held in-camera. The Investigating Officer was called to give his statement. The girl’s parents, who were present at court, were also not asked to leave the courtroom. Outside the courtroom, the accused’s family and friends clapped when his legal team walked out the courtroom and revealed he had been granted bail. Daily News
