DURBAN – While many moms will woke up to breakfast in bed on Sunday, for some it was a case of breakfast in cells, as in police or prison cells. I’m not referring to those spending the day at the Baby Mother Unit of Pollsmoor (see page 3) but the two mothers taken in during a sting by the Hawks in connection with the UKZN med school scandal (see also page 6). Well done to Nabeelah Shaikh for persevering on the story. We hope the varsity’s anti-fraud hotline will be ringing non-stop with people coming forward to save KZN’s top institution from corruption. A politician destined for greatness has taken up top office and vowed to fight corruption in South Korea and help bolster world peace (page 11). There’s also some promising news about the Syrian conflict. One of my role models and former editor, Dennis Pather, who was part of the anti-apartheid leadership that came out of the bush college without a bush that was Salisbury Island, was so inspired by a speech by an island veteran that he passed it on to us. It’s a reflection of the “learning and unlearning” that happened there (page 16). As the hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners intensifies, Imraan Buccus asks whether South Africa is still on the right side of history and social justice (page 17). On page 20, the DA’s Ann McDonnell argues the recently tabled KZN economic development budget in no way addresses chronic youth unemployment. eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede, following last week’s WEF Africa, says we now need to maintain the momentum for inclusive growth and economic transformation. And what to make of Cyril Ramaphosa’s “apology”? (Page 21) See what Pather has to say (page 20). There’s a different take on our Big Issue page. You be the judge. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
