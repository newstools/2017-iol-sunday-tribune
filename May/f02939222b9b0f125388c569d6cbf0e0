Deputy eThekwini Mayor Fawzia Peer got interactive with some mothers of City at the Blue Lagoon Conference Centre this week and shared the following Mother's Day message: Mother's Day is a celebration honoring the mother of the family, as well as motherhood, maternal bonds, and the influence of mothers in society. It is celebrated today in South Africa, and has become highly commercialised. Almost every shop is having some sale or the other in 'support' of this day. As a result it loses its true meaning. I am of the view that Mothers Day should be celebrated every day. Our Mothers are the anchor in our lives and they always place the interests of their children above their own. Almost every mother in this country knows that today is Mothers Day. Some will be spoilt by their families and others will remember their mums who have passed on, visiting cemeteries and placing flowers. In my work I have come across many mothers who are forgotten. They lie in old age homes in the hope that someone in their families will remember them. These are the women that we need to embrace on this day. I have decided to host a breakfast for some mothers from various old age homes and spend time with them as a gesture of love and sharing our joys of motherhood, earlier this week.. I'm hoping that this will grow into a bigger event where we reach out to all mothers throughout our city and honour them at a function, possibly at Moses Mabhida stadium, the next time. This is to let them know that we are truly a caring city. Councillor Fawzia Peer SUNDAY TRIBUNE
