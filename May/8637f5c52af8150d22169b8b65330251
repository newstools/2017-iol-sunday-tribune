The busy road’s poor condition was cause for concern and responsible for accidents, the motorists said. The highway is mostly used by heavy vehicles and buses ferrying commuters and goods. Commuters and drivers say the road has been in a poor condition for over two years. They say the road has no cat’s-eyes and is plagued by uneven road surfaces, overgrown bushes and faded markings. Disgruntled motorist Tony Ball, who uses the road frequently, said driving on the highway at night was extremely dangerous. “In some areas, edges of the road are hidden by the bush, you cannot pull off in case of emergency.” The complainants also allege that due to neglect of the road by the department, vehicles were more likely to be involved in accidents. Ruth Fish said there were blind and sharp curves on the highway which needed to be monitored regularly. KZN Department of Transport spokesperson Mluleki Mntungwa said according to the department’s road maintenance plan, all roads were due for maintenance every three months. The recent heavy rains were the cause of the overgrown trees, he said. “We have noted the problem. The markings are clear, but we will explore other options, such as putting in more road cat’s-eyes to improve visibility, especially at night, said Mntungwa. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
