Durban - Bail was opposed for the Durban teacher accused of sending nude photographs of himself to a pupil at his school in Sydenham. The teacher appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Monday where friends and family gathered in their numbers to show support. Allegations were levelled against the teacher, a well-known figure in the community, after a father claimed the teacher was sending messages of a sexual nature to his 14-year old daughter. There were also claims of nude images from the teacher on the girl’s cellphone. A second parent has since spoken to the Daily News with similar claims. The woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of her daughter, claimed that the teacher promised to give her daughter a kiss on her birthday. The girl felt uncomfortable and alerted her mother about the messages. In court, the State Prosecutor said they were opposing bail because of the accused’s personal circumstances and address, both of which still needed to be verified by police. He was remanded in custody pending his next court appearance on May 22. Daily News
