DURBAN - The University of KwaZulu-Natal has confirmed the medical school campus will be shutdown until next Monday. This comes after the medical school’s SRC has demanded the release of a forensic report into the sale of places at the medical school. The university paid auditing firm R1.4m for the report last year, but the document has been kept under-wraps. UKZN’s acting spokesperson, Normah Zondo, said in a communique to staff and students that the decision to close the campus was taken amidst protest action on campus. “The medical school has been closed today following protest action on that campus. This morning, staff were escorted off campus due to entrances to the campus being blocked off by students.  Management condemns the damage to property that has also occurred,” she said. “The medical school student leadership has submitted a list of governance matters to management for consideration. Among the matters raised is the release of the KPMG Forensic report into the sale of places at the medical school,” she said. Council will meet with the medical school SRC on Monday. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
