In April, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) charged waste management giant EnviroServ and its chief executive, Dean Thompson. However, senior state advocate Yuri Gangai told the Durban Magistrate's Court the charge sheet had not been finalised because of new evidence which could see more charges and accused persons being added. EnviroServ has come in for severe criticism over its management of the landfill from neighbouring communities who alleged the site is emitting toxic fumes that were making them ill. The criminal charges followed months of investigation by the Green Scorpions. “It was found during the search that EnviroServ Waste Management (Pty) Ltd had failed to comply with the provisions of environmental law and certain conditions of the waste management licence issued in terms of the National Environmental Management Waste Act of 2008,” Department of Environmental Affairs spokesperson Albi Modise said. According to the act, a waste management licence holder must take all reasonable measures to manage the waste so it does not endanger health or the environment or cause a nuisance through noise, odour or visual impacts. Yesterday EnviroServ spokesperson Thabiso Taaka confirmed the additional charges. The matter will be back in court on August 17.  nokuthula.ntuli@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
