DURBAN: Queen of Bollywood, Shreya Ghoshal, returns to Durban shores this month to serenade locals in a star-studded night of Deewani Mastani. The internationally acclaimed nightingale, who won over local hearts during her 2015 concert at Durban’s ICC, is back by popular demand, according to event organisers Showtime Promotions and Blu Blood. Showtime’s Vinay Hansraj said: “At the 2015 event we had to turn away about 3000 people because tickets were sold-out, and we are nearly sold out for this latest show. People just love her.” Ghoshal has lent her charming voice to iconic Bollywood filmmakers, creating chart-busting hits, which includes Radha on the Dancefloor and Sun Raha Hi Tu. About what fans could expect, Hansraj assured that the award-winning musician will render her big hits and take audiences back in time with some golden oldies. “Shreya’s voice is dripping with honey, she epitomizes melody and has sustained this since then movie Devdas, where it all began,” said Hansraj. Ghoshal is expected to better her previous South African showing with the support of Indian vocalist, Kinjal Chattopadhyay and Sony Entertainment TV stars, Shaheer Sheik who features in Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi and Kushal Tandon from Beyhadh. The songbird said, “I am so fortunate that my music takes me around the world, and I’m absolutely delighted that I get to return to the beautiful South Africa.” * The concert is scheduled for Durban’s ICC on August 19. Tickets are available at Computicket. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
