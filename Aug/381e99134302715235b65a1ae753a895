DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal DA leader Zwakele Mncwango told party supporters in Durban on Tuesday that South Africa will only prosper once the ANC is removed from power. Mncwango delivered the speech ahead of the no-confidence vote against President Jacob Zuma where he said “the ANC is cancer and Zuma is just a cancerous cell that should be removed”. “We have to remove this cell to stop corruption and the Guptas from destroying our country but that doesn't heal this nation. The solution is to remove the ANC,” Mncwango. Mncwango told party supporters not to be optimistic and think that removing Zuma would solve the nation's problems as Zuma was only part of the problem.

He said even if presidential hopeful, Cyril Ramaphosa took power after the elective conference in December, South Africa would still be in trouble. Adding that destroying the ANC via the ballot in the 2019 general elections was the only means to ensure prosperity of South Africa. Mncwango reminded supporters of the role of opposition saying “even if you are a minority you still have a voice in democracy.” POLITICS
