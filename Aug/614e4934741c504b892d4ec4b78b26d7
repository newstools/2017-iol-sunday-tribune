The controversial dancer and entertainer Zodwa Wabantu took to social media yesterday, inquiring about work at a popular strip joint, The Summit Club, in Johannesburg. “Guys help Summit @Joburg is a Strip Club right? Booking duties...all my life I was called Umagosha & a Stripper this I wanna see & enjoy fully👑 If the are Customers there are Buyers Society at its Best👑❤” Zodwa explained that since she has been called a prostitute and stripper for the way she dances and dresses, she may as well become a stripper for real and get paid for her sexy dancing. The Durban-born socialite called out society for being quick to slut-shame women for dressing sexy, but saying nothing about their brothers, sons, and fathers who are customers at places like The Summit. Zodwa wa Bantu: Picture: Instagram “Society don't discuss such but can label any Woman wearing sexy outfits...If this girls Work here who are the Customers,our Brothers,Father's & Society, Awuve nizenza ncono ngathi thina abantu besfazane sifelani ngokubizwa ngama gama kodwa niyasikhwela emini nase busuku. Instead of helping us, we went to School kodwa reality is I have to survive no matter what" she wrote. Why drag Bonang into Nonhle's Twitter rant? Watch Zodwa practice pole dancing: All my life i've been called a Stripper so I called a good friend of mine who owns Clubs to take me to that Booth 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 check the results 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🙈 turn every Word said to you into Magic A post shared by zodwalibram (@zodwalibram) on Aug 15, 2017 at 8:14am PDT IOL
