Durban - Police have opened an inquest into the death of a Verulam woman who killed herself after an apparent feud with her mother-in-law over he cleanliness of the kitchen cupboards. The 30-year-old mother of two young children was found hanging from a scarf attached to a shower arm after neighbours, assisted by members of private security firm, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) forced their way into her home. According to Prem Balram, director of Rusa, security officers were called to a home in Verulam at 11am on Tuesday after neighbours informed their control room that a two-year-old and a five-year-old had been locked out of their home, and their mother was not responding to their calls. "Neighbours then proceeded to the residence and peered through the open bathroom window and found the children's mother hanging by a scarf from the shower arm," Balram said. "In an attempt to save the woman's life Reaction officers broke the lock on the security gate and entered the home. Officers then forced open the lock on the bathroom door to allow paramedics to gain entry. The woman showed no signs of life and was declared dead a short while later," he said. Balram said the woman's emotional husband who arrived on scene blamed the suicide on his mother who had a week-long dispute with the deceased regarding the cleanliness of the kitchen cupboards. "A few minutes later the husband, who also threatened to commit suicide, fled the scene in a white Nissan Sentra and was found near the Verulam Recreational Grounds and restrained by Reaction Officers. Investigations into the matter are currently underway," he said. Daily News
