DURBAN -Â THE KwaZulu-Natal Mountain Biking (MTB) Commission has joined the Western Province MTB Commission in offering support for the South African mountain biking team which was chosen to represent the country in Australia next month. The KZN MTB Commission is a volunteer organisation established in terms of the constitution of Cycling KZN, and is a subsidiary of Cycling KZN.
Following the recent decision by Cycling SA not to fund South African teams travelling to international competitions, the KZN and WP Commissions have offered R50 000 and R30 000 respectively to support riders to represent their country in Cairns from September 5-10. Eight of the 18 riders selected for the South African team are from KwaZulu-Natal. The KZN MTB Commission has decided the money will be donated to the entire team so riders and support staff from all the provinces are able to benefit from the donation. "We take great pleasure in being able to support the team," said Ian Smith, the KZN MTB Commission chairperson. "Good governance and financial controls has enabled us to be in a position to help the team. "We would hate to have riders being forced to withdraw from the chance of representing their country because they do not have any funds and so we felt it was important to help the entire team. "I think there will still be a shortfall for the entire tour so I anticipate riders still having to contribute privately, but hopefully our help will ensure the full team can represent the country."  nokuthula.ntuli@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
