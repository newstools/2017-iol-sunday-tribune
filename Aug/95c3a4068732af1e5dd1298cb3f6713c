DURBAN - Beaches along the south coast have been closed to bathers as the city braces for a cold snap due to hit the country that is expected to bring with it high sea swells. Ethekwini spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said due to high seas forecasted for the next couple of days, the Reunion, Pipeline, Warners and uMgababa beaches have been temporarily closed. "This decision was taken after careful deliberation with the South African Weather Bureau and the Sharks Board. The closure entails the lifting of shark nets at the above mentioned beaches. The Municipality will continue to monitor all other beaches. Should it become necessary to close any other beaches, members of the public will be notified accordingly. We apologise for any inconvenience caused," she said. The South African Weather Services has  predicted significant snowfalls and heavy rains for KwaZulu-Natal this week. Forecasters said South Africans could expect a cold snap to affect most the country during the latter part of this week, specifically from Wednesday onwards. Temperatures in parts of KwaZulu-Natal were expected to drop to as low as five degrees Celsius and reach highs of just 10 degrees Celsius. During the period, “significant snowfalls” could also be expected over the southern and central Drakensberg. Daily News
