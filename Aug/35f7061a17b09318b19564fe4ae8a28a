DURBAN: Break the silence, disrupt rape culture were some of the messages displayed on the placards carried by Durban University of Technology students during their silent protest, earlier today.
The students were out to raise awareness on the alarming epidemic of gender-based violence in the country.
They walked silently from Steve Biko Campus to the Durban City Hall with their mouths taped, and as a show of breaking the silence on gender based violence, the ripped off the black sticky tape at the end of the protest.
Students said it was important to raise awareness and spread the word of unity against violence against women. Therefore,  they stood in solidarity with violence and abuse survivors who usually silenced by their experiences.
Among the protesters were #FeesMustFall activist, Bonginkosi “ Education” Khanyile, who said, he too has had a family member raped previously.
“Historically and culturally, women have always been devalued and their femininity undermined in society, and made to feel like second rates citizens . Today we are saying not in our name, we are breaking silence on the victimisation, rape and abuse of women,”  said Khanyile.
The march was also supported by Larisa Klazinga from Aids Healthcare Foundation, she said the organisation understands there was a clear link between HIV Aids and gender based violence.
“ We know rape incidents are rife in South Africa and we know that we are unable to stop HIV Aids infection, and we notice there’s a relationship between rape and infection. As an organisation we are using events like these to circulate information on post exposure prophylaxis, which is available free of charge at any public health care facility. 
"If you had been raped, go to the hospital, tell somebody, and you would receive medication that could prevent HIV Aids infection,” said Klazinga. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
