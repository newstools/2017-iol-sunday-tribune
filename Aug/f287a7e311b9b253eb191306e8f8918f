The 30-year-old, who is based at fire stations around Durban, took the title at the Toughest Fire Fighter Alive 2017 competition in Germany and will also be looking to defend her title as KwaZulu-Natal’s top firefighter later this month at the annual firefighter challenge in Durban. Having won in Germany in June, Mbanjwa told The Independent on Saturday that the competition was challenging: it included dragging a 90kg statue for 60m, crawling through 30m tunnels and back again, as well as climbing 16 floors at pace with a cylinder on her back. And the dedicated firefighter, who grew up on the South Coast, says it is all about keeping fit and being mentally tough. As well as training at the gym at the station, Mbanjwa runs on the beach to keep fit. “I think since I was born I have wanted to be a firefighter. For me, it’s about rescuing people and saving property.” And her advice for young women ahead of Women’s Day: “You have to be positive and confident in yourself.” When she’s not at work, Mbanjwa spends time at church and is studying towards furthering her career. “I would like to be a station commander one day. It’s about being dedicated and willing to work hard,” she said. Station commander Justin Bateman said Durban firefighters were “massively proud” of Mbanjwa and her achievements. “We take our fitness very seriously and the brigade is a very strong team. “The firefighting industry used to be male-dominated, but now we have ladies who have to be able to pick up 100kg. They have to be just as strong. “Being a firefighter is about having intelligence, endurance, strength and mental fortitude,” said Bateman. INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY
