DURBAN:The dream of turning uMhlanga into the “Sandton of Durban” is slowly being realised. Investors forked out no less than R2.1 million each to grab a piece of the pie of the new mixed-use development called the Skye uMhlanga. The project is spearheaded by the Saantha Naidu Group of Companies. The launch of its first phase on Saturday, included 180 upmarket drive-up flats and a commercial block. Construction is expected to start at the end of this year. Phase two will see the creation of the luxury Skye Hotel, as hotel mogul Naidu, aimed to add another hospitality development to his portfolio. He owns several luxury Durban hotels including the Coastlands Hotels, the iconic Royal Hotel, the Zimbali Luxury Villas and the 30 Degrees Umdloti Beach Resort. The 180 unit development had already been 30% sold before the official launch began. By 5pm Saturday 65% of units had been sold. The development was set to change the Durban skyline within the next few years and was among a handful of residential developments in Durban to include the concept of drive-up flats. But the idea was also to create a high-end playground for the elite who liked to spend their time enjoying the commercial and hospitality offerings in uMhlanga. The second phase would see the building of a luxury hotel, and more office space. Naidu said Skye was intended to create a luxurious lifestyle and investment opportunity, with locals getting preference. “The idea is that the design will include a timeless blend of meticulous craftsmanship with modern and sophisticated finishes, where form meets function,” Naidu added. The new development will offer one- to four-bedroom flats with exquisite sea, city and garden views. The biggest units will be penthouses with a private garden at 709 m2, and will sell for between R14.6 to R21.65m. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
