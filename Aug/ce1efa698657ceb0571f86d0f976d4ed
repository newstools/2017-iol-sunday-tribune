DURBAN - A vibey aerobics session outside Durban's City Hall was interrupted by hundreds of supporters of the alleged sex pest pastor, Tim Omotoso, after their march on Friday. A group of about 700 congregants belonging to Omotoso’s Jesus International Church marched from King Dinizulu Park to the city hall calling for the release of their pastor on bail. Omotoso remains behind bars after he was arrested in Port Elizabeth in April this year. The 58-year-old pastor faces human trafficking and sexual violence charges for allegedly luring upto 30 women and girls - some as young as 13, from various branches of his church, to his Umhlanga Rocks house, where they were then sexually exploited.

Chanting “asigudluki, asinavalo”, which loosely translates to we are not moving, we are not scared - the congregants disrupted the group of fitness enthusiasts by chanting and getting stuck in the middle of the group, causing them to move out of their way. “Please don’t put my name in the newspaper this is an eThekwini Municipality event, I’m just a service provider,” said Maphumulo when approached for comment. It is not clear how the two events ended up clashing because both parties claimed they had the right to occupy the space in front of the hall.  nokuthula.ntuli@inl.co.za  Supporters of Tim Omotoso came out in their numbers.
