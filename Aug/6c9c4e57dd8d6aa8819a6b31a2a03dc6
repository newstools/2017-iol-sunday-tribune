Durban - ANC Treasurer-General Zweli Mkhize has joined the growing chorus of people who want to see Deputy Minister Mduduzi Manana rebuked for beating a woman. The incident, which could proved to be a turning point in Manana’s political career, took place at Cubana nightclub in Johannesburg, recently. Mkhize said, “This issue around the deputy minister is of course an embarrassing issue. It’s not an issue that we can hide away from...obviously all of us are waiting with huge expectation on how that matter is handled.” He was responding to comments made by the daughter of anti-apartheid stalwart, Yusuf Dadoo, Roshan, who asked, “how is it okay that such things are happening under the ANC government?” Mkhize was speaking during the memorial lecture of former anti-apartheid activist Dr Phyllis Naidoo, at Durban’s University of KwaZulu-Natal this week. “She (Roshan) is not the only person raising that matter. I think all of us were surprised that you could have someone in that high office being involved in such an incident,” said Mkhize. While Mkhize accepted the ANC were not judges, he said the parties expected the mater to be handled appropriately but he was not prepared to comment on what the outcome would be. With mounting calls for Manana to resign, his fate now is in the hands of President Jacob Zuma, who ultimately has the powers to appoint and remove cabinet members. Manana has been a member of Parliament since 2009. The ANC women's league, led by Bathabile Dlamini rushed to Manana's defence, saying if he’s charges than other woman beaters in the ANC must also face the wrath of the law. Mkhize, who is the former KZN premier was addressed as the “president-in-waiting” by two audience members. Manana is out on R5000 bail. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
