DURBAN: A Durban designer made waves in the international branding industry after he was inducted into the Loeries Hall of Fame for his creative genius last week.
Nathan Reddy, 47, who grew up in Overport, never imagined his work would one day feature on billboards in cities around the world. His works of art have been splashed prominently in Paris, cities in the US, and Abu Dhabi and Qatar. The Loeries is an annual awards ceremony for creative inspiration - helping marketers, agencies and consumers appreciate the value of the industry. Reddy became the youngest person to be inducted into the hall of fame. His work has been used by companies such as Telkom, MTN, First National Bank, Brand SA, Liberty and Slow Lounge. Reddy, who is the chief creative officer and founder of Grid Worldwide Branding and Design, said he grew up keen to pursue a career in design. “While my friends wanted to become doctors and lawyers, it was always my dream to explore my creative talent. I pursued a graphic design diploma at the ML Sultan Technikon and came top of my class in my final year,” said Reddy. He moved to Joburg and, after years spent gaining experience at three companies, he launched out on his own - with the Grid. Reddy, who is always on the move, has a 23-year-old daughter who, he said, inspired him. He spends much of his time travelling, but when he’s in the country, he spends time with his mother and daughter. “I divorced a while ago, so my daughter is my world. She’s at an understanding age, so spending time away from home is no problem. I am able to balance work and family time well,” said Reddy. Being inducted into the hall of fame came as a “huge surprise”, particularly because of his age. “It truly is an honour to have such an accolade bestowed on me,” said Reddy.  nabeelah.shaikh@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
