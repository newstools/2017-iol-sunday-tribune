The R220-million hotel - the first Hilton in South Africa and now undergoing an additional R200m phased refurbishment - welcomed its first guests a day before the neighbouring Durban International Convention Centre was opened by then president Nelson Mandela. Over the years, famous doorman Obed Mbatha, who won a city Living Legends Award in 2013, has accumulated 675 badges on his uniform jacket, every one donated by a guest. His jacket weighs 3.5kg. Mbatha, 75, also the winner of a chief executive’s award, vowed to keep working for another 10 years. Also a well-known face at the entrance is doorman Patrick Gumede, who with his colleagues, will mark the occasion today with a special birthday cake. Maintenance man Gabriel Hlengwa was the hotel’s team member of the year in 2015, while head concierge Wellington Nzuza is now the proud owner of the internationally-recognised Golden Keys. The keys, which he wears on his lapels, are kept in the safe when he is off duty. Theo Mazeka, who started work at the Hilton as the night auditor, is now the IT manager, while Venessa Maistry, who started off working in room service, is the manager in the hotel’s new-look restaurant, Vasco’s.
