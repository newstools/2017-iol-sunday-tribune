Life Response spokesman, Leon Fourie said metro had put up advance barriers and alerts following the first accident. 
"We were attending to three patients following a collision between a vehicle and a taxi. A roll back (tow truck) had arrived to remove the vehicle and was parked behind the ambulance. Behind the rollback, metro police had put up advance warning beacons," sad Fourie. 
A second taxi came up the fast lane, close to the accident scene where it collided with another car before losing control and then crashing into the rollback truck.
On impact the rollback was pushed forward into the ambulance, where the paramedics were treating a patient. 
The taxi driver had to be extricated from his vehicle with the jaws of life.

All the injured were taken to nearby hospitals. 
"The dangers we face daily are real. Everyday we risk our lives to save another's. We urge all road users to slow down at accident scenes and pay attention to traffic control measures that are put in place," said Fourie.
