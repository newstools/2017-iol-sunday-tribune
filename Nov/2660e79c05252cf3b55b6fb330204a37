The gospel music artists are expected to dazzle in their extravagant gowns and dapper tuxedos. TV personality Pearl Modiadie and musician Thabo Mdluli are due to  return as MCs after they hosted the awards ceremony last year. The awards are even bigger this year, with 40 categories to mark the 10th anniversary of the event. The new categories - the artist of the decade and song of the decade - seek to honour artists who have stayed relevant in the past 10 years. One such artist is Sfiso Ncwane who has been post-
humously nominated as artist of the decade. Ncwane's song Kulungile Baba is nominated for song of the decade. Ncwane died in December last year after kidney failure. He had attended the Crown Gospel Awards shortly before his sudden death. Ncwane’s wife, Ayanda, will walk the red carpet with their sons Ngcweti and Mawenza tonight. “We are humbled by both nominations,” Ayanda said. “Although Bab’ Ncwane is no more, people continue to support his work. His hard work and investment in the industry is showing off through the accolades that he keeps receiving,” she said. Coping with Ncwane’s death was difficult and she still cried a lot, she said. “Although we are crying that he left us early and that we never had enough time with him, we receive comfort through his music and the word of God,” said Ayanda. Also nominated for an award in the category of gospel song of the decade are Benjamin Dube, Hlengiwe Mhlaba and Winnie Mashaba. The build-up to the awards started on Thursday with a prayer for all gospel artists and nominees. That was followed by the Christian Expo Africa, an exhibition of DVDs, CDs and books. The Crown Gospel Awards will be broadcast on SABC 2 at 8pm.  siphelele.buthelezi@inl.co.za
