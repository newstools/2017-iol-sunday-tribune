DURBAN - AFTER 33 years on radio helping direct Durbanites away from traffic jams and collisions, the famous “JVB The Traffic Guy” is calling it quits and packing away his microphone. East Coast Radio’s Johann Von Bargen will this afternoon bid his farewell to listeners when he delivers his last traffic reports between 4pm and 6pm on The Drive Show with Bongani Mtolo and Mags. JVB has been with ECR since inception. As he packs away his microphone, he said he would continue to work by doing advanced driver training courses and anti-hijacking seminars. “I will miss daily interactions with the ‘roadies’, the people who take the trouble to share information with me about road incidents, they are such great people. I will also miss the listeners,” he said. On the lessons he learned as a traffic reporter he said he had learned to expect the unexpected. “I’ve learned that anything can happen at any stage. When you think it is really quiet on the roads there can be a major collision that will bring Durban to a halt. Things can change in a split second” said Von Bargen. The station’s General Manager Boni Mchunu thanked JVB for his dedication. “JVB has been a good friend to the station and our listeners, therefore we can never say goodbye. We will simply say see you soon on the KZN roads,” said Mchunu. The station’s programmes manager, Zane Derbyshire, said Von Bargen’s contribution to the station was immense. “He is widely recognised as one of the top traffic guys in the country and he is also a world-renowned defensive driving specialist.  We’d like to thank JVB for all his years of service and for reliably guiding our listeners to and from work every day for so many years. He has been a pleasure to work with and the team, including our listeners, will miss him.” said Derbyshire. On social media, many wished JVB well in tweets.
