DURBAN - The KZN Department of Co-operative Governance and weather forecasters have warned people in the Midlands and the southern parts of the province to be wary of the heavy storm from Friday afternoon. SA weather forecaster, Victoria Nurse warned that of heavy showers were expected tonight along the South Coast. The showers would be accompanied by moderate north easterly winds. She warned of the severe thunderstorms in the Midlands, Drakensberg, Newcastle, Ladysmith and also on the KZN South Soast. “We expect clearance on Saturday morning but this could not be similar to the previous storm early last month. However, we are concerned with heavy rains along the coast,” she said. KZN Cogta spokesperson, Lennox Mabaso, said the department was calling on people to be extra cautionary. In a statement on Friday, he said ferocious storms were set to hit the Midlands and southern parts of the province. “Communities are urged to be on alert and to exercise extra caution as they undertake their activities.  The Disaster Management Centres in all areas set to be affected by these inclement weather conditions have been activated and are on high alert to intervene should they be required. However, the first line of defence is the people and their conduct in such life threatening conditions,” said Mabaso. Mabaso said people should minimise their movements and said those living in low lying areas are urged to “take note of potential flooding and mudslides”. “Road users should not take unnecessary risks and are urged to be extra careful as they undertake their journeys. No one should attempt to cross low-lying bridges during flooding.  We urge citizens to take this warning seriously as it might prove to be the difference between life and death,” said Mabaso.
