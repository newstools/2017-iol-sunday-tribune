DURBAN - POLICE in KwaZulu-Natal have arrested six alleged hitmen believed to be involved in taxi-related violence, armed robberies, and hijackings. The arrests were made on Tuesday by an operational services intervention consisting of the Tactical Response Team unit, the National Intervention Unit, Public Order Police and the Airwing. They were intercepted just outside Richards Bay. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the units were working tirelessly to curb senseless killings in KZN. She said the team was currently working in the Far North of KZN, where people were killed last week in an attack. The six alleged hitmen who were arrested on Tuesday were between the ages of 34 and 52. Mbhele said they have been linked to alleged criminal activity in KZN and in Gauteng. “It is alleged that they have been operating between Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal and are involved in taxi-related incidents, police killings, ATM bombings, cash-in-transit heists, political killings, armed robbery and hijackings. The suspects were arrested just outside Richards Bay and were found in possession of seven unlicensed firearms and ammunition,” said Mbhele. The firearms have been sent for ballistic testing. Meanwhile, KZN’s acting provincial police commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa praised the police for the arrests. “I would like to commend our members for their dedication that led to the arrests of these suspects and the recovery of seven firearms. We are confident that arrest of these men will contribute to stemming incidents of violence across the province. We commend members of the community who came forward and decided to work with our team to bring down these thugs. It shows that our communities still have confidence in the police and despise criminals,” said Langa. THE INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY
