DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal may be having more bucket loads of rain this week, but it is not enough to get the province out of a drought just yet. “The Standard Precipitation Index shows that the rainfall in the region has been better of the past 6 months but over a 36 month period the majority of KZN is still classified as severe to extreme drought,” said the Department of Water and Sanitation’s (DWS) Sputnik Ratau. Dams are still averaging below 50% and the water restrictions have been relaxed but not completely lifted. “A number of the smaller dams have recovered and are no longer showing the impacts of the drought but the larger dams may take a few more years to recover,” said Ratau. Meanwhile, construction is almost complete on of the Hazelmere Dam, in Verulam, to the north of Durban. The dam, which is one of those that were severely affected by the drought is undergoing a R600 million renovation which will see the dam walls rising by seven metres to increase the capacity from 17 Ml/day. “This will increase the yield that can be supplied to the northern part of eThekwini Municipality and the northern coastal strip by an additional 20 Ml/day. The current contractual completion date is 15 January 2018. Delays on the project are predominantly due to unforeseen construction challenges influenced by the dam foundation treatment,” Ratau explained.  nokuthula.ntuli@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
