The Sunday Tribune asked previous Idols SA contestants, among them winners and a former top 5 contestant who went on to make smash hits, who would make the top 3 and, ultimately, who would win the competition. They are now also holding thumbs for their favourite to clinch the competition. The singing competition is down to public vote but 17-year-old Paxton is the favourite. Pop singer Kyle Deutsch, a former Idols SA contestant, will perform a duet with 
Paxton on the show tonight. Kyle said Paxton was his favourite contestant. “Paxton will definitely remain in the competition, she has done very well. I also look forward to her performance, she is a good singer. I am also rooting for the two Durban contestants, Phindy and Mthokozisi , they deserve a top 3 spot,” said Deutsch. Season 11 Idols SA winner Karabo Mogane is also rooting for the young Paxton. “I haven’t been following all the episodes because I don’t have much time for TV. However, I have seen Paxton perform and she is good. I also think Phindy and Mthokozisi will make it to the top 3,” said Mogane. Karabo and Kyle believe Botlhale will be sent home tonight despite the Pretoria singer wowing the judges in previous weeks. “This is the most critical stage of the competition, contestants must stick to who they are. They must not change their style because they are nearing the end, they must stick to their formula,” he said. Last season’s Idols SA winner Noma Khumalo from  Pietermaritzburg said she was routing for all the contestants. “All of them deserve to continue with the competition, I can’t single out any of them, they are all good singers. Those who won’t make it to the final must not be discouraged, I hope they use the information and contacts they made while in the competition because it will definitely open doors to the music industry,” said Khumalo.  *  You can vote for your favourite contestant via WeChat or SMS.
