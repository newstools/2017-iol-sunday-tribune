RAPPER AKA’s record label, BEAM Group, has responded to the alleged xenophobic comments, that the rapper’s former management company laid against Prince Nyembe from his record label. Vth Season boss Raphael Benza, who is Liberian, alleges that hateful and xenophobic e-mails were sent to him by Nyembe. He has reportedly approached the South African Human Rights Commission. He said the claims were hateful, injurious and xenophobic comments made by Nyembe via emails addressed to him on several occasions. It is alleged that there was a dispute over money between Vth Season and BEAM Group which boiled over during an e-mail exchange between Nyembe and Benza. “And your clever? your just a criminal that’s all .left your shit country to come take advantage of our talented people!! go home !!you don’t belong here .” (sic) That was allegedly one of the e-mails Nyembe sent to Benza. The rapper AKA, whose real name is Kiernan Forbes, is allegedly copied in the communication. The statement by BEAM Group said the context shared in the communication by Vth Season was one sided and not conclusive of Benza’s emails towards BEAM Group. They said the statements shared were taken out of context and further said they were yet to receive communication from the SAHRC. Benza’s lawyer David Feinberg said AKA has not spoken out against the utterances of Nyembe and on email chan. “Mr Benza will leave this in the hands of the HRCSA but an apology to Mr Benza, the people of Liberia (who Mr Nyembe suggested in his e-mail was a “shit” country) and all victims of xenophobia would at least going some way into remedying the harm,”
