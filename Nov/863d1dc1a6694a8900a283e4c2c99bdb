Durban - Veteran ANC member Reverend Frank Chikane has called on South Africans not to turn a blind eye to state capture and looting, which he described as treason. Chikane, who is the senior vice president of the SA Council of Churches, was speaking during the launch of the KZN Christian Council’s 2019 election observation programme in Durban on Tuesday. “We all need to be guardians of our democracy,” he said. The programme will see at least 67 000 observers deployed to more than 22 000 voting stations around the country during the 2019 general elections. He said the council’s election programme was aimed at preventing the corrupting of the electoral system and process. “We are saying, if you can corrupt the electoral system of the country, what can stop you from corrupting the nation?” He said the country was at its worst moment since 1994 because of corruption. Chikane said he supported the radical economic transformation but refused to be hoodwinked by corrupt individuals who used to term to dress their corruption. “We need radical change in the economy but I don’t want a rotten corrupt person to tell me about radical economic transformation,” he said. Chikane said the council’s programme was not targeting any political party. “I am not against the ANC; I am against the ANC leader who is corrupt,” said Chikane.  nokuthula.ntuli@inl.co.za
