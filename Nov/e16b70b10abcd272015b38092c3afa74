Nathi Nkwanyana is alleged to have made arrangements with individuals within the municipality to secure lucrative tenders, then allegedly “cut a deal” for his own gain. Nkwanyana was the head of the unit that operates the troubled Revenue Management Services (RMS) system. The controversial unit has been in the spotlight for several months after Durban residents vented their frustrations over receiving exorbitant utility bills, as a result of the chaotic system. Three weeks ago, mayor Zandile Gumede admitted that residents were being billed incorrectly and called for an inquiry into the system. The municipality has been silent about Nkwanyana’s suspension. However, staff claimed they were aware of it. They said they were shocked when it happened as he was a long-standing employee. City spokesperson Tozi Mthethwa said: “The city does not discuss disciplinary matters in the media. Due processes in relation to the Labour Relations Act and the Municipal Finance Management Act are applied to all disciplinary matters. The municipality has also recently appointed a financial disciplinary board to provide oversight on all disciplinary matters that have a financial impact,” said Mthethwa. She said the city’s integrity and investigations unit reported to the municipal public accounts committee on disciplinary cases and this would continue. Nkwanyana said he could not comment.
