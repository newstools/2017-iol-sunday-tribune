Ngcobo was suspended from  
his job following the last-minute cancellation of the R2.1 million 3-day social cohesion conference, which was to take place in June. He went to the Labour Court to challenge his suspension and was reinstated. Ngcobo’s fresh suspension came after the DA  wrote to the city manager, Sipho Nzuza, in October asking what had been done to recover the aborted conference’s wasteful expenditure and requested that action be taken against whoever was responsible. Ngcobo’s attorney Reg Thomas said his client would appear before a disciplinary committee on Friday. “The city claims that he did not adhere to the so-called instruction to cancel the event in advance, the consequences of which resulted in wasteful expenditure and brought
the city into disrepute,” he said. “We are of the view that the allegations of his conduct are unfounded because the officials only informed him of the cancellation in writing on the day of the event. “The allegations against Mr Ngcobo are malicious. Blaming him is clearly malicious,” said Thomas. The leader of the IFP Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi was expected to speak at the conference.  siphelele.buthelezi@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
