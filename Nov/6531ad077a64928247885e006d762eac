DURBAN - BABES Wodumo will not attend the MTV European Music Awards in London this Sunday, the Tribune can reveal. Instead of boarding a flight to London's Heathrow International Airport, the Sunday Tribune can reveal that the bubbly Babes Wodumo was instead promoting the West Ink Banger Vol. 1 album at Gagasi FM's Kings of the Drive show with Sphectacula and Naves on Friday Afternoon. She was with her beau-cum-manager, Mampintsha. West Ink Records has already informed MTV that she will not be going. Babes Wodumo is no stranger to bungling when international awards shows come calling, in June, the self-proclaimed Queen of Gqom missed out on the BET Awards in the US where she had been nominated for an award after her team failed to sort out her travel visa documents in time.

The Sunday Tribune understands however, that Babes Wodumo’s visa was sorted in time this time around, but sources have revealed that they expected the organisers to pay for travel and accommodation costs. Babes Wodumo is in contention for an MTV European Music Award in the Best African category, along side local rapper Nasty C, Nigeria’s Wizkid and Davido, Angola’s C4 Pedro and Kenya’s Nyashinski.

Her many bungles saw her nominated for a Feathers Awards in the Drama Queen of the Year category, which was eventually won by Zodwa Wabantu.

In an emailed statement to the Sunday Tribune,  Alex Okosi, Executive Vice President and Managing Director of Viacom International Media Networks Africa (VIMN Africa) confirmed they had received written communication that she would not attend the awards. “Our communication to all artists has always been equal and clear that VIMN Africa does not fly nominees to the MTV EMAs. We have confirmed this with all the nominees. As it relates to talent, we only fly performers to the MTV EMAs awards show. We had received written confirmation from Babes Wodumo’s team that they elected to not attend the MTV EMAs.” said Okosi on Friday. Meanwhile, Babes Wodumo appeared unfazed by it all, taking to Instagram to publicise her new song with Ntando Duma.
