The houses will be built by the provincial Department of Co-operative Government and Traditional Affairs (Cogta). This emerged in a parliamentary reply from Cogta to a question posed by the DA in KZN. This comes after an uproar last month over R32m upgrades at the KZN premier’s official residence. Opposition parties have labelled the spending wasteful but Cogta spokesperson Lennox Mabaso has defended it. DA chief whip in the provincial legislature, Francois Rodgers, said: “I don’t think it should be the responsibility of the provincial government to build houses for tribal chiefs. The fact of the matter is that we don’t have money.” The programme stemmed from President Jacob Zuma signing a proclamation promulgating an increase in the stipends paid to izinduna, from R1300 to R8600 a month in 2014. Rodgers claimed Cogta had frozen projects aimed at changing the lives of destitute people so that it could build houses for tribal chiefs. Another bone of contention was the criteria used to choose recipients of the houses. The IFP’s Blessed Gwala said: “The recipients are chosen based on their allegiance to the ruling party other chiefs are sidelined.” The NFP’s Vikizitha Mlotshwa said Zuma had announced the houses for chiefs prior to the 2014 general elections to woo voters. “But he didn’t consult relevant people who could have told him that it was not feasible due to the economic situation the country was in,” he said. But Mabaso fired back: “This was a government programme passed by Parliament. There’s no drama to it.” He shot down claims that the programme sidelined other traditional leaders not aligned to the ANC. “Izinduna (headmen) are beyond politics. They are the fathers and unifiers of 
the nation.” He said amakhosi also had to have official residences. “That’s why we are building these houses, where they can host their guests not under the trees,” said Mabaso. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
